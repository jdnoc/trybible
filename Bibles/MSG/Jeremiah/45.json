{"1":"This is what Jeremiah told Baruch one day in the fourth year of Jehoiakim's reign as he was taking dictation from the prophet:","2":"\"These are the words of GOD, the God of Israel, to you, Baruch.","3":"You say, \"These are bad times for me! It's one thing after another. GOD is piling on the pain. I'm worn out and there's no end in sight.'","4":"\"But GOD says, \"Look around. What I've built I'm about to wreck, and what I've planted I'm about to rip up.","5":"And I'm doing it everywhere--all over the whole earth! So forget about making any big plans for yourself. Things are going to get worse before they get better. But don't worry. I'll keep you alive through the whole business.'\""}
