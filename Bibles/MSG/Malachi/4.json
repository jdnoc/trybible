{"1":"\"Count on it: The day is coming, raging like a forest fire. All the arrogant people who do evil things will be burned up like stove wood, burned to a crisp, nothing left but scorched earth and ash--a black day.","2":"But for you, sunrise! The sun of righteousness will dawn on those who honor my name, healing radiating from its wings. You will be bursting with energy, like colts frisky and frolicking.","3":"And you'll tromp on the wicked. They'll be nothing but ashes under your feet on that Day.\" GOD-of-the-Angel-Armies says so.","4":"\"Remember and keep the revelation I gave through my servant Moses, the revelation I commanded at Horeb for all Israel, all the rules and procedures for right living.","5":"\"But also look ahead: I'm sending Elijah the prophet to clear the way for the Big Day of GOD-the decisive Judgment Day!","6":"He will convince parents to look after their children and children to look up to their parents. If they refuse, I'll come and put the land under a curse.\""}
