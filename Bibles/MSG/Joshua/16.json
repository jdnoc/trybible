{"1":"The lot for the people of Joseph went from the Jordan near Jericho, east of the spring of Jericho, north through the desert mountains to Bethel.","2":"It went on from Bethel (that is, Luz) to the territory of the Arkites in Ataroth.","3":"It then descended westward to the territory of the Japhletites to the region of Lower Beth Horon and on to Gezer, ending at the Sea.","4":"This is the region from which the people of Joseph--Manasseh and Ephraim--got their inheritance. [JC]","5":"Ephraim's territory by clans: The boundary of their inheritance went from Ataroth Addar in the east to Upper Beth Horon","6":"and then west to the Sea. From Micmethath on the north it turned eastward to Taanath Shiloh and passed along, still eastward, to Janoah.","7":"The border then descended from Janoah to Ataroth and Naarah; it touched Jericho and came out at the Jordan.","8":"From Tappuah the border went westward to the Brook Kanah and ended at the Sea. This was the inheritance of the tribe of Ephraim by clans,","9":"including the cities set aside for Ephraim within the inheritance of Manasseh--all those towns and their villages.","10":"But they didn't get rid of the Canaanites who were living in Gezer. Canaanites are still living among the people of Ephraim, but they are made to do forced labor. [JC]"}
