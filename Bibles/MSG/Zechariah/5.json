A book flying!","2":"The Messenger-Angel said to me, \"What do you see now?\" I said, \"I see a book flying, a huge book--thirty feet long and fifteen wide!\"","3":"He told me, \"This book is the verdict going out worldwide against thieves and liars. The first half of the book disposes of everyone who steals; the second half takes care of everyone who lies.","4":"I launched it\"--Decree of GOD-of-the-Angel-Armies--\"and so it will fly into the house of every thief and every liar.
