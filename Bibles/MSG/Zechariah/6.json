{"1":"Once again I looked up--another strange sight! Four chariots charging out from between two mountains. The mountains were bronze.","2":"The first chariot was drawn by red horses, the second chariot by black horses,","3":"the third chariot by white horses, and the fourth chariot by dappled horses. All the horses were powerful.","4":"I asked the Messenger-Angel, \"Sir, what's the meaning here?\"","5":"The angel answered, \"These are the four winds of heaven, which originate with the Master of the whole earth.","6":"The black horses are headed north with the white ones right after them. The dappled horses are headed south.\"","7":"The powerful horses galloped out, bursting with energy, eager to patrol through the earth. The Messenger-Angel commanded: \"On your way! Survey the earth!\" and they were off in every direction.","8":"Then he called to me and said, \"Look at them go! The ones going north are conveying a sense of my Spirit, serene and secure. No more trouble from that direction.\"","9":"Then this Message from GOD came to me:","10":"\"Take up a collection from the exiles. Target Heldai, Tobiah, and Jedaiah. They've just arrived from Babylon. You'll find them at the home of Josiah son of Zephaniah.","11":"Collect silver and gold from them and fashion crowns. Place one on the head of Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest,","12":"and give him this message: A Message from GOD-of-the-Angel-Armies. Be alert. We have a man here whose name is Branch. He will branch out from where he is and build the Temple of GOD.","13":"Yes, he's the one. He'll build the Temple of GOD. Then he'll assume the role of royalty, take his place on the throne and rule--a priest sitting on the throne!-showing that king and priest can coexist in harmony.'","14":"\"The other crown will be in the Temple of GOD as a symbol of royalty, under the custodial care of Helem, Tobiah, Jedaiah, and Hen son of Zephaniah.","15":"\"People will come from faraway places to pitch in and rebuild the Temple of GOD. This will confirm that GOD-of-the-Angel-Armies did, in fact, send me to you. All this follows as you put your minds to a life of responsive obedience to the voice of your GOD.\""}
