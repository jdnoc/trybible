{"1":"The Messenger-Angel again called me to attention. It was like being wakened out of deep sleep.","2":"He said, \"What do you see?\" I answered, \"I see a lampstand of solid gold with a bowl on top. Seven lamps, each with seven spouts, are set on the bowl.","3":"And there are two olive trees, one on either side of the bowl.\"","4":"Then I asked the Messenger-Angel, \"What does this mean, sir?\"","5":"The Messenger-Angel said, \"Can't you tell?No, sir,\" I said. Then he said,","6":"\"This is GOD's Message to Zerubbabel: \"You can't force these things. They only come about through my Spirit,' says GOD-of-the-Angel-Armies.","7":"\"So, big mountain, who do you think you are? Next to Zerubbabel you're nothing but a molehill. He'll proceed to set the Cornerstone in place, accompanied by cheers: Yes! Yes! Do it!'\"","8":"After that, the Word of GOD came to me:","9":"\"Zerubbabel started rebuilding this Temple and he will complete it. That will be your confirmation that GOD-of-the-Angel-Armies sent me to you.","10":"Does anyone dare despise this day of small beginnings? They'll change their tune when they see Zerubbabel setting the last stone in place!\" Going back to the vision, the Messenger-Angel said, \"The seven lamps are the eyes of GOD probing the dark corners of the world like searchlights.\"","11":"\"And the two olive trees on either side of the lampstand?\" I asked. \"What's the meaning of them?","12":"And while you're at it, the two branches of the olive trees that feed oil to the lamps--what do they mean?\"","13":"He said, \"You haven't figured that out?\" I said, \"No, sir.\"","14":"He said, \"These are the two who stand beside the Master of the whole earth and supply golden lamp oil worldwide.\""}
