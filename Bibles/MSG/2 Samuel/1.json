{"1":"Shortly after Saul died, David returned to Ziklag from his rout of the Amalekites.","2":"Three days later a man showed up unannounced from Saul's army camp. Disheveled and obviously in mourning, he fell to his knees in respect before David.","3":"David asked, \"What brings you here?\" He answered, \"I've just escaped from the camp of Israel.\"","4":"\"So what happened?\" said David. \"What's the news?\" He said, \"The Israelites have fled the battlefield, leaving a lot of their dead comrades behind. And Saul and his son Jonathan are dead.\"","5":"David pressed the young soldier for details: \"How do you know for sure that Saul and Jonathan are dead?\"","6":"\"I just happened by Mount Gilboa and came on Saul, badly wounded and leaning on his spear, with enemy chariots and horsemen bearing down hard on him.","7":"He looked behind him, saw me, and called me to him. \"Yes sir,' I said, \"at your service.'","8":"He asked me who I was, and I told him, \"I'm an Amalekite.'\"","9":"\"Come here,\" he said, \"and put me out of my misery. I'm nearly dead already, but my life hangs on.\"","10":"\"So I did what he asked--I killed him. I knew he wouldn't last much longer anyway. I removed his royal headband and bracelet, and have brought them to my master. Here they are.\"","11":"In lament, David ripped his clothes to ribbons. All the men with him did the same.","12":"They wept and fasted the rest of the day, grieving the death of Saul and his son Jonathan, and also the army of GOD and the nation Israel, victims in a failed battle.","13":"Then David spoke to the young soldier who had brought the report: \"Who are you, anyway?I'm from an immigrant family--an Amalekite.\"","14":"\"Do you mean to say,\" said David, \"that you weren't afraid to up and kill GOD's anointed king?\"","15":"Right then he ordered one of his soldiers, \"Strike him dead!\" The soldier struck him, and he died.","16":"\"You asked for it,\" David told him. \"You sealed your death sentence when you said you killed GOD's anointed king.\"","17":"Then David sang this lament over Saul and his son Jonathan,","18":"and gave orders that everyone in Judah learn it by heart. Yes, it's even inscribed in The Book of Jashar.","19":"Oh, oh, Gazelles of Israel, struck down on your hills, the mighty warriors--fallen, fallen!","20":"Don't announce it in the city of Gath, don't post the news in the streets of Ashkelon. Don't give those coarse Philistine girls one more excuse for a drunken party!","21":"No more dew or rain for you, hills of Gilboa, and not a drop from springs and wells, For there the warriors' shields were dragged through the mud, Saul's shield left there to rot.","22":"Jonathan's bow was bold--the bigger they were the harder they fell. Saul's sword was fearless--once out of the scabbard, nothing could stop it.","23":"Saul and Jonathan--beloved, beautiful! Together in life, together in death. Swifter than plummeting eagles, stronger than proud lions.","24":"Women of Israel, weep for Saul. He dressed you in finest cottons and silks, spared no expense in making you elegant.","25":"The mighty warriors--fallen, fallen in the middle of the fight! Jonathan--struck down on your hills!","26":"O my dear brother Jonathan, I'm crushed by your death. Your friendship was a miracle-wonder, love far exceeding anything I've known--or ever hope to know.","27":"The mighty warriors--fallen, fallen. And the arms of war broken to bits."}
