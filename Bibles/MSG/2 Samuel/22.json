His road stretches straight and smooth. Every GOD-direction is road-tested. Everyone who runs toward him Makes it.","32":"Is there any god like GOD? Are we not at bedrock?","33":"Is not this the God who armed me well, then aimed me in the right direction?","34":"Now I run like a deer; I'm king of the mountain.","35":"He shows me how to fight; I can bend a bronze bow!","36":"You protect me with salvation-armor; you touch me and I feel ten feet tall.","37":"You cleared the ground under me so my footing was firm.","38":"When I chased my enemies I caught them; I didn't let go till they were dead men.","39":"I nailed them; they were down for good; then I walked all over them.","40":"You armed me well for this fight; you smashed the upstarts.","41":"You made my enemies turn tail, and I wiped out the haters.","42":"They cried \"uncle\" but Uncle didn't come; They yelled for GOD and got no for an answer.","43":"I ground them to dust; they gusted in the wind. I threw them out, like garbage in the gutter.","44":"You rescued me from a squabbling people; you made me a leader of nations. People I'd never heard of served me;","45":"the moment they got wind of me they submitted.","46":"They gave up; they came trembling from their hideouts.","47":"Live, GOD! Blessing to my Rock, my towering Salvation-God!","48":"This God set things right for me and shut up the people who talked back.","49":"He rescued me from enemy anger. You pulled me from the grip of upstarts, You saved me from the bullies.","50":"That's why I'm thanking you, GOD, all over the world. That's why I'm singing songs that rhyme your name.","51":"God's king takes the trophy; God's chosen is beloved. I mean David and all his children--always."}
