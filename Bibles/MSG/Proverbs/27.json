{"1":"Don't brashly announce what you're going to do tomorrow; you don't know the first thing about tomorrow.","2":"Don't call attention to yourself; let others do that for you.","3":"Carrying a log across your shoulders while you're hefting a boulder with your arms Is nothing compared to the burden of putting up with a fool.","4":"We're blasted by anger and swamped by rage, but who can survive jealousy?","5":"A spoken reprimand is better than approval that's never expressed.","6":"The wounds from a lover are worth it; kisses from an enemy do you in.","7":"When you've stuffed yourself, you refuse dessert; when you're starved, you could eat a horse.","8":"People who won't settle down, wandering hither and yon, are like restless birds, flitting to and fro.","9":"Just as lotions and fragrance give sensual delight, a sweet friendship refreshes the soul.","10":"Don't leave your friends or your parents' friends and run home to your family when things get rough; Better a nearby friend than a distant family.","11":"Become wise, dear child, and make me happy; then nothing the world throws my way will upset me.","12":"A prudent person sees trouble coming and ducks; a simpleton walks in blindly and is clobbered.","13":"Hold tight to collateral on any loan to a stranger; be wary of accepting what a transient has pawned.","14":"If you wake your friend in the early morning by shouting \"Rise and shine!\" It will sound to him more like a curse than a blessing.","15":"A nagging spouse is like the drip, drip, drip of a leaky faucet;","16":"You can't turn it off, and you can't get away from it.","17":"You use steel to sharpen steel, and one friend sharpens another.","18":"If you care for your orchard, you'll enjoy its fruit; if you honor your boss, you'll be honored.","19":"Just as water mirrors your face, so your face mirrors your heart.","20":"Hell has a voracious appetite, and lust just never quits.","21":"The purity of silver and gold is tested by putting them in the fire; The purity of human hearts is tested by giving them a little fame.","22":"Pound on a fool all you like--you can't pound out foolishness.","23":"Know your sheep by name; carefully attend to your flocks;","24":"(Don't take them for granted; possessions don't last forever, you know.)","25":"And then, when the crops are in and the harvest is stored in the barns,","26":"You can knit sweaters from lambs' wool, and sell your goats for a profit;","27":"There will be plenty of milk and meat to last your family through the winter."}
