{"1":"Dear friend, pay close attention to this, my wisdom; listen very closely to the way I see it.","2":"Then you'll acquire a taste for good sense; what I tell you will keep you out of trouble.","3":"The lips of a seductive woman are oh so sweet, her soft words are oh so smooth.","4":"But it won't be long before she's gravel in your mouth, a pain in your gut, a wound in your heart.","5":"She's dancing down the primrose path to Death; she's headed straight for Hell and taking you with her.","6":"She hasn't a clue about Real Life, about who she is or where she's going.","7":"So, my friend, listen closely; don't treat my words casually.","8":"Keep your distance from such a woman; absolutely stay out of her neighborhood.","9":"You don't want to squander your wonderful life, to waste your precious life among the hardhearted.","10":"Why should you allow strangers to take advantage of you? Why be exploited by those who care nothing for you?","11":"You don't want to end your life full of regrets, nothing but sin and bones,","12":"Saying, \"Oh, why didn't I do what they told me? Why did I reject a disciplined life?","13":"Why didn't I listen to my mentors, or take my teachers seriously?","14":"My life is ruined! I haven't one blessed thing to show for my life!\"","15":"Do you know the saying, \"Drink from your own rain barrel, draw water from your own spring-fed well\"?","16":"It's true. Otherwise, you may one day come home and find your barrel empty and your well polluted.","17":"Your spring water is for you and you only, not to be passed around among strangers.","18":"Bless your fresh-flowing fountain! Enjoy the wife you married as a young man!","19":"Lovely as an angel, beautiful as a rose--don't ever quit taking delight in her body. Never take her love for granted!","20":"Why would you trade enduring intimacies for cheap thrills with a whore? for dalliance with a promiscuous stranger?","21":"Mark well that GOD doesn't miss a move you make; he's aware of every step you take.","22":"The shadow of your sin will overtake you; you'll find yourself stumbling all over yourself in the dark.","23":"Death is the reward of an undisciplined life; your foolish decisions trap you in a dead end."}
