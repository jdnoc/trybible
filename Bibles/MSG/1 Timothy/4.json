{"1":"The Spirit makes it clear that as time goes on, some are going to give up on the faith and chase after demonic illusions put forth by professional liars.","2":"These liars have lied so well and for so long that they've lost their capacity for truth.","3":"They will tell you not to get married. They'll tell you not to eat this or that food--perfectly good food God created to be eaten heartily and with thanksgiving by Christians!","4":"Everything God created is good, and to be received with thanks. Nothing is to be sneered at and thrown out.","5":"God's Word and our prayers make every item in creation holy.","6":"You've been raised on the Message of the faith and have followed sound teaching. Now pass on this counsel to the Christians there, and you'll be a good servant of Jesus.","7":"Stay clear of silly stories that get dressed up as religion. Exercise daily in God--no spiritual flabbiness, please!","8":"Workouts in the gymnasium are useful, but a disciplined life in God is far more so, making you fit both today and forever.","9":"You can count on this. Take it to heart.","10":"This is why we've thrown ourselves into this venture so totally. We're banking on the living God, Savior of all men and women, especially believers.","11":"Get the word out. Teach all these things.","12":"And don't let anyone put you down because you're young. Teach believers with your life: by word, by demeanor, by love, by faith, by integrity.","13":"Stay at your post reading Scripture, giving counsel, teaching.","14":"And that special gift of ministry you were given when the leaders of the church laid hands on you and prayed--keep that dusted off and in use.","15":"Cultivate these things. Immerse yourself in them. The people will all see you mature right before their eyes!","16":"Keep a firm grasp on both your character and your teaching. Don't be diverted. Just keep at it. Both you and those who hear you will experience salvation."}
