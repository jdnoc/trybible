{"1":"Jotham was twenty-five years old when he became king; he reigned sixteen years at Jerusalem. His mother was Jerusha the daughter of Zadok.","2":"In GOD's eyes he lived a good life, following the path marked out by his father Uzziah. Unlike his father, though, he didn't desecrate The Temple of GOD. But the people pushed right on in their lives of corruption.","3":"Jotham constructed the Upper Gate of The Temple of GOD, considerably extended the Wall of the Ophel,","4":"and built cities in the high country of Judah and forts and towers down in the forests.","5":"He fought and beat the king of the Ammonites--that year the Ammonites turned over three and a quarter tons of silver and about sixty-five bushels of wheat, and another sixty-five bushels of barley. They repeated this for the next two years.","6":"Jotham's strength was rooted in his steady and determined life of obedience to GOD.","7":"The rest of the history of Jotham, including his wars and achievements, are all written in the Royal Annals of the Kings of Israel and Judah.","8":"He was twenty-five years old when he became king; he reigned for sixteen years at Jerusalem.","9":"Jotham died and was buried in the City of David. His son Ahaz became the next king."}
