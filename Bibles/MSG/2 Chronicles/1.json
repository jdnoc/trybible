{"1":"Solomon son of David took a firm grip on the reins of his kingdom. GOD was with him and gave him much help.","2":"Solomon addressed all Israel--the commanders and captains, the judges, every leader, and all the heads of families.","3":"Then Solomon and the entire company went to the worship center at Gibeon--that's where the Tent of Meeting of God was, the one that Moses the servant of GOD had made in the wilderness.","4":"The Chest of God, though, was in Jerusalem--David had brought it up from Kiriath Jearim, prepared a special place for it, and pitched a tent for it.","5":"But the Bronze Altar that Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, had made was in Gibeon, in its place before the Tabernacle of GOD; and that is where Solomon and the congregation gathered to pray.","6":"Solomon worshiped GOD at the Bronze Altar in front of the Tent of Meeting; he sacrificed a thousand Whole-Burnt-Offerings on it.","7":"That night God appeared to Solomon. God said, \"What do you want from me? Ask.\"","8":"Solomon answered, \"You were extravagantly generous with David my father, and now you have made me king in his place.","9":"Establish, GOD, the words you spoke to my father, for you've given me a staggering task, ruling this mob of people.","10":"Yes, give me wisdom and knowledge as I come and go among this people--for who on his own is capable of leading these, your glorious people?\"","11":"God answered Solomon, \"This is what has come out of your heart: You didn't grasp for money, wealth, fame, and the doom of your enemies; you didn't even ask for a long life. You asked for wisdom and knowledge so you could govern well my people over whom I've made you king.","12":"Because of this, you get what you asked for--wisdom and knowledge. And I'm presenting you the rest as a bonus--money, wealth, and fame beyond anything the kings before or after you had or will have.\"","13":"Then Solomon left the worship center at Gibeon and the Tent of Meeting and went to Jerusalem. He set to work as king of Israel.","14":"Solomon collected chariots and horses: 1,400 chariots and 12,000 horses! He stabled them in the special chariot-cities as well as in Jerusalem.","15":"The king made silver and gold as common as rocks, and cedar as common as the fig trees in the lowland hills.","16":"His horses were brought in from Egypt and Cilicia, specially acquired by the king's agents.","17":"Chariots from Egypt went for fifteen pounds of silver and a horse for about three and three-quarters of a pound of silver. Solomon carried on a brisk horse-trading business with the Hittite and Aramean royal houses."}
