{"1":"GOD spoke to Moses:","2":"\"Make two bugles of hammered silver. Use them to call the congregation together and give marching orders to the camps.","3":"When you blow them, the whole community will meet you at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting.","4":"\"When a bugle gives a single, short blast, that's the signal for the leaders, the heads of the clans, to assemble.","5":"When it gives a long blast, that's the signal to march. At the first blast the tribes who were camped on the east set out.","6":"At the second blast the camps on the south set out. The long blasts are the signals to march.","7":"The bugle call that gathers the assembly is different from the signal to march.","8":"\"The sons of Aaron, the priests, are in charge of blowing the bugles; it's their assigned duty down through the generations.","9":"When you go to war against an aggressor, blow a long blast on the bugle so that GOD will notice you and deliver you from your enemies.","10":"Also at times of celebration, at the appointed feasts and New Moon festivals, blow the bugles over your Whole-Burnt-Offerings and Peace-Offerings: they will keep your attention on God. I am GOD, your God.\"","11":"In the second year, on the twentieth day of the second month, the Cloud went up from over The Dwelling of The Testimony.","12":"At that the People of Israel set out on their travels from the Wilderness of Sinai until the Cloud finally settled in the Wilderness of Paran.","13":"They began their march at the command of GOD through Moses.","14":"The flag of the camp of Judah led the way, rank after rank under the command of Nahshon son of Amminadab.","15":"Nethanel son of Zuar commanded the forces of the tribe of Issachar,","16":"and Eliab son of Helon commanded the forces of the tribe of Zebulun.","17":"As soon as The Dwelling was taken down, the Gershonites and the Merarites set out, carrying The Dwelling.","18":"The flag of the camp of Reuben was next with Elizur son of Shedeur in command.","19":"Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai commanded the forces of the tribe of Simeon;","20":"Eliasaph son of Deuel commanded the forces of the tribe of Gad.","21":"Then the Kohathites left, carrying the holy things. By the time they arrived The Dwelling would be set up.","22":"The flag of the tribe of Ephraim moved out next, commanded by Elishama son of Ammihud.","23":"Gamaliel son of Pedahzur commanded the forces of the tribe of Manasseh;","24":"Abidan son of Gideoni commanded the forces of the tribe of Benjamin.","25":"Finally, under the flag of the tribe of Dan, the rear guard of all the camps marched out with Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai in command.","26":"Pagiel son of Ocran commanded the forces of the tribe of Asher;","27":"Ahira son of Enan commanded the forces of the tribe of Naphtali.","28":"These were the marching units of the People of Israel. They were on their way.","29":"Moses said to his brother-in-law Hobab son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses' father-in-law, \"We're marching to the place about which GOD promised, \"I'll give it to you.' Come with us; we'll treat you well. GOD has promised good things for Israel.\"","30":"But Hobab said, \"I'm not coming; I'm going back home to my own country, to my own family.\"","31":"Moses countered, \"Don't leave us. You know all the best places to camp in the wilderness. We need your eyes.","32":"If you come with us, we'll make sure that you share in all the good things GOD will do for us.\"","33":"And so off they marched. From the Mountain of GOD they marched three days with the Chest of the Covenant of GOD in the lead to scout out a campsite.","34":"The Cloud of GOD was above them by day when they marched from the camp.","35":"With the Chest leading the way, Moses would say, Get up, GOD! Put down your enemies! Chase those who hate you to the hills!","36":"And when the Chest was set down, he would say, Rest with us, GOD, Stay with the many, Many thousands of Israel."}
