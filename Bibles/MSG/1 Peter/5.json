{"1":"I have a special concern for you church leaders. I know what it's like to be a leader, in on Christ's sufferings as well as the coming glory.","2":"Here's my concern: that you care for God's flock with all the diligence of a shepherd. Not because you have to, but because you want to please God. Not calculating what you can get out of it, but acting spontaneously.[","3":"Not bossily telling others what to do, but tenderly showing them the way.","4":"When God, who is the best shepherd of all, comes out in the open with his rule, he'll see that you've done it right and commend you lavishly.","5":"And you who are younger must follow your leaders. But all of you, leaders and followers alike, are to be down to earth with each other, for--God has had it with the proud, But takes delight in just plain people.","6":"So be content with who you are, and don't put on airs. God's strong hand is on you; he'll promote you at the right time.","7":"Live carefree before God; he is most careful with you.","8":"Keep a cool head. Stay alert. The Devil is poised to pounce, and would like nothing better than to catch you napping.","9":"Keep your guard up. You're not the only ones plunged into these hard times. It's the same with Christians all over the world. So keep a firm grip on the faith.","10":"The suffering won't last forever. It won't be long before this generous God who has great plans for us in Christ--eternal and glorious plans they are!-will have you put together and on your feet for good.","11":"He gets the last word; yes, he does.","12":"I'm sending this brief letter to you by Silas, a most dependable brother. I have the highest regard for him. I've written as urgently and accurately as I know how. This is God's generous truth; embrace it with both arms!","13":"The church in exile here with me--but not for a moment forgotten by God--wants to be remembered to you. Mark, who is like a son to me, says hello.","14":"Give holy embraces all around! Peace to you--to all who walk in Christ's ways."}
