We don't want anyone looking down on God's Message because of their behavior.","6":"Also, guide the young men to live disciplined lives.","7":"But mostly, show them all this by doing it yourself, incorruptible in your teaching,","8":"your words solid and sane.

Then their good character will shine through their actions, adding luster to the teaching of our Savior God.","11":"God's readiness to give and forgive is now public. Salvation's available for everyone!","12":"We're being shown how to turn our backs on a godless, indulgent life, and how to take on a God-filled, God-honoring life. This new life is starting right now,","13":"and is whetting our appetites for the glorious day when our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ, appears.","14":"He offered himself as a sacrifice to free us from a dark, rebellious life into this good, pure life, making us a people he can be proud of, energetic in goodness.","15":"Tell them all this.
