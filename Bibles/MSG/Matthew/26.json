{"1":"When Jesus finished saying these things, he told his disciples,","2":"\"You know that Passover comes in two days. That's when the Son of Man will be betrayed and handed over for crucifixion.\"","3":"At that very moment, the party of high priests and religious leaders was meeting in the chambers of the Chief Priest named Caiaphas,","4":"conspiring to seize Jesus by stealth and kill him.","5":"They agreed that it should not be done during Passover Week. \"We don't want a riot on our hands,\" they said.","6":"When Jesus was at Bethany, a guest of Simon the Leper,","7":"a woman came up to him as he was eating dinner and anointed him with a bottle of very expensive perfume.","8":"When the disciples saw what was happening, they were furious. \"That's criminal!","9":"This could have been sold for a lot and the money handed out to the poor.\"","10":"When Jesus realized what was going on, he intervened. \"Why are you giving this woman a hard time? She has just done something wonderfully significant for me.","11":"You will have the poor with you every day for the rest of your lives, but not me.","12":"When she poured this perfume on my body, what she really did was anoint me for burial.","13":"You can be sure that wherever in the whole world the Message is preached, what she has just done is going to be remembered and admired.\"","14":"That is when one of the Twelve, the one named Judas Iscariot, went to the cabal of high priests","15":"and said, \"What will you give me if I hand him over to you?\" They settled on thirty silver pieces.","16":"He began looking for just the right moment to hand him over.","17":"On the first of the Days of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus and said, \"Where do you want us to prepare your Passover meal?\"","18":"He said, \"Enter the city. Go up to a certain man and say, \"The Teacher says, My time is near. I and my disciples plan to celebrate the Passover meal at your house.'\"","19":"The disciples followed Jesus' instructions to the letter, and prepared the Passover meal.","20":"After sunset, he and the Twelve were sitting around the table.","21":"During the meal, he said, \"I have something hard but important to say to you: One of you is going to hand me over to the conspirators.\"","22":"They were stunned, and then began to ask, one after another, \"It isn't me, is it, Master?\"","23":"Jesus answered, \"The one who hands me over is someone I eat with daily, one who passes me food at the table.","24":"In one sense the Son of Man is entering into a way of treachery well-marked by the Scriptures--no surprises here. In another sense that man who turns him in, turns traitor to the Son of Man--better never to have been born than do this!\"","25":"Then Judas, already turned traitor, said, \"It isn't me, is it, Rabbi?\" Jesus said, \"Don't play games with me, Judas.\"","26":"During the meal, Jesus took and blessed the bread, broke it, and gave it to his disciples: Take, eat. This is my body.","27":"Taking the cup and thanking God, he gave it to them: Drink this, all of you.","28":"This is my blood, God's new covenant poured out for many people for the forgiveness of sins.","29":"\"I'll not be drinking wine from this cup again until that new day when I'll drink with you in the kingdom of my Father.\"","30":"They sang a hymn and went directly to Mount Olives.","31":"Then Jesus told them, \"Before the night's over, you're going to fall to pieces because of what happens to me. There is a Scripture that says, I'll strike the shepherd; helter-skelter the sheep will be scattered.","32":"But after I am raised up, I, your Shepherd, will go ahead of you, leading the way to Galilee.\"","33":"Peter broke in, \"Even if everyone else falls to pieces on account of you, I won't.\"","34":"\"Don't be so sure,\" Jesus said. \"This very night, before the rooster crows up the dawn, you will deny me three times.\"","35":"Peter protested, \"Even if I had to die with you, I would never deny you.\" All the others said the same thing.","36":"Then Jesus went with them to a garden called Gethsemane and told his disciples, \"Stay here while I go over there and pray.\"","37":"Taking along Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he plunged into an agonizing sorrow.","38":"Then he said, \"This sorrow is crushing my life out. Stay here and keep vigil with me.\"","39":"Going a little ahead, he fell on his face, praying, \"My Father, if there is any way, get me out of this. But please, not what I want. You, what do you want?\"","40":"When he came back to his disciples, he found them sound asleep. He said to Peter, \"Can't you stick it out with me a single hour?","41":"Stay alert; be in prayer so you don't wander into temptation without even knowing you're in danger. There is a part of you that is eager, ready for anything in God. But there's another part that's as lazy as an old dog sleeping by the fire.\"","42":"He then left them a second time. Again he prayed, \"My Father, if there is no other way than this, drinking this cup to the dregs, I'm ready. Do it your way.\"","43":"When he came back, he again found them sound asleep. They simply couldn't keep their eyes open.","44":"This time he let them sleep on, and went back a third time to pray, going over the same ground one last time.","45":"When he came back the next time, he said, \"Are you going to sleep on and make a night of it? My time is up, the Son of Man is about to be handed over to the hands of sinners.","46":"Get up! Let's get going! My betrayer is here.\"","47":"The words were barely out of his mouth when Judas (the one from the Twelve) showed up, and with him a gang from the high priests and religious leaders brandishing swords and clubs.","48":"The betrayer had worked out a sign with them: \"The one I kiss, that's the one--seize him.\"","49":"He went straight to Jesus, greeted him, \"How are you, Rabbi?\" and kissed him.","50":"Jesus said, \"Friend, why this charade?\" Then they came on him--grabbed him and roughed him up.","51":"One of those with Jesus pulled his sword and, taking a swing at the Chief Priest's servant, cut off his ear.","52":"Jesus said, \"Put your sword back where it belongs. All who use swords are destroyed by swords.","53":"Don't you realize that I am able right now to call to my Father, and twelve companies--more, if I want them--of fighting angels would be here, battle-ready?","54":"But if I did that, how would the Scriptures come true that say this is the way it has to be?\"","55":"Then Jesus addressed the mob: \"What is this--coming out after me with swords and clubs as if I were a dangerous criminal? Day after day I have been sitting in the Temple teaching, and you never so much as lifted a hand against me.","56":"You've done it this way to confirm and fulfill the prophetic writings.\" Then all the disciples cut and ran.","57":"The gang that had seized Jesus led him before Caiaphas the Chief Priest, where the religion scholars and leaders had assembled.","58":"Peter followed at a safe distance until they got to the Chief Priest's courtyard. Then he slipped in and mingled with the servants, watching to see how things would turn out.","59":"The high priests, conspiring with the Jewish Council, tried to cook up charges against Jesus in order to sentence him to death.","60":"But even though many stepped up, making up one false accusation after another, nothing was believable. Finally two men came forward","61":"with this: \"He said, \"I can tear down this Temple of God and after three days rebuild it.'\"","62":"The Chief Priest stood up and said, \"What do you have to say to the accusation?\"","63":"Jesus kept silent. Then the Chief Priest said, \"I command you by the authority of the living God to say if you are the Messiah, the Son of God.\"","64":"Jesus was curt: \"You yourself said it. And that's not all. Soon you'll see it for yourself: The Son of Man seated at the right hand of the Mighty One, Arriving on the clouds of heaven.\"","65":"At that, the Chief Priest lost his temper, ripping his robes, yelling, \"He blasphemed! Why do we need witnesses to accuse him? You all heard him blaspheme!","66":"Are you going to stand for such blasphemy?\" They all said, \"Death! That seals his death sentence.\"","67":"Then they were spitting in his face and banging him around. They jeered as they slapped him:","68":"\"Prophesy, Messiah: Who hit you that time?\"","69":"All this time, Peter was sitting out in the courtyard. One servant girl came up to him and said, \"You were with Jesus the Galilean.\"","70":"In front of everybody there, he denied it. \"I don't know what you're talking about.\"","71":"As he moved over toward the gate, someone else said to the people there, \"This man was with Jesus the Nazarene.\"","72":"Again he denied it, salting his denial with an oath: \"I swear, I never laid eyes on the man.\"","73":"Shortly after that, some bystanders approached Peter. \"You've got to be one of them. Your accent gives you away.\"","74":"Then he got really nervous and swore. \"I don't know the man!\" Just then a rooster crowed.","75":"Peter remembered what Jesus had said: \"Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.\" He went out and cried and cried and cried."}
