{"1":"It said, \"Son of man, stand up. I have something to say to you.\"","2":"The moment I heard the voice, the Spirit entered me and put me on my feet. As he spoke to me, I listened.","3":"He said, \"Son of man, I'm sending you to the family of Israel, a rebellious nation if there ever was one. They and their ancestors have fomented rebellion right up to the present.","4":"They're a hard case, these people to whom I'm sending you--hardened in their sin. Tell them, \"This is the Message of GOD, the Master.'","5":"They are a defiant bunch. Whether or not they listen, at least they'll know that a prophet's been here.","6":"But don't be afraid of them, son of man, and don't be afraid of anything they say. Don't be afraid when living among them is like stepping on thorns or finding scorpions in your bed. Don't be afraid of their mean words or their hard looks. They're a bunch of rebels.","7":"Your job is to speak to them. Whether they listen is not your concern. They're hardened rebels.","8":"\"Only take care, son of man, that you don't rebel like these rebels. Open your mouth and eat what I give you.\"","9":"When I looked he had his hand stretched out to me, and in the hand a book, a scroll.","10":"He unrolled the scroll. On both sides, front and back, were written lamentations and mourning and doom."}
