{"1":"Then the Spirit picked me up and took me to the gate of the Temple that faces east. There were twenty-five men standing at the gate. I recognized the leaders, Jaazaniah son of Azzur and Pelatiah son of Benaiah.","2":"GOD said, \"Son of man, these are the men who draw up blueprints for sin, who think up new programs for evil in this city.","3":"They say, \"We can make anything happen here. We're the best. We're the choice pieces of meat in the soup pot.'","4":"\"Oppose them, son of man. Preach against them.\"","5":"Then the Spirit of GOD came upon me and told me what to say: \"This is what GOD says: \"That's a fine public speech, Israel, but I know what you are thinking.","6":"You've murdered a lot of people in this city. The streets are piled high with corpses.'","7":"\"Therefore this is what GOD, the Master, says: \"The corpses that you've piled in the streets are the meat and this city is the soup pot, and you're not even in the pot! I'm throwing you out!","8":"You fear war, but war is what you're going to get. I'm bringing war against you.","9":"I'm throwing you out of this city, giving you over to foreigners, and punishing you good.","10":"You'll be killed in battle. I'll carry out judgment on you at the borders of Israel. Then you'll realize that I am GOD.","11":"This city will not be your soup pot and you won't be the choice pieces of meat in it either. Hardly. I will carry out judgment on you at the borders of Israel","12":"and you'll realize that I am GOD, for you haven't followed my statutes and ordinances. Instead of following my ways, you've sunk to the level of the laws of the nations around you.'\"","13":"Even while I was preaching, Pelatiah son of Benaiah died. I fell down, face to the ground, and prayed loudly, \"O Master, GOD! Will you completely wipe out what's left of Israel?\"","14":"The answer from GOD came back:","15":"\"Son of man, your brothers--I mean the whole people of Israel who are in exile with you--are the people of whom the citizens of Jerusalem are saying, \"They're in the far country, far from GOD. This land has been given to us to own.'","16":"\"Well, tell them this: \"This is your Message from GOD, the Master. True, I sent you to the far country and scattered you through other lands. All the same, I've provided you a temporary sanctuary in the countries where you've gone.","17":"I will gather you back from those countries and lands where you've been scattered and give you back the land of Israel.","18":"You'll come back and clean house, throw out all the rotten images and obscene idols.","19":"I'll give you a new heart. I'll put a new spirit in you. I'll cut out your stone heart and replace it with a red-blooded, firm-muscled heart.","20":"Then you'll obey my statutes and be careful to obey my commands. You'll be my people! I'll be your God!","21":"But not those who are self-willed and addicted to their rotten images and obscene idols! I'll see that they're paid in full for what they've done.' Decree of GOD, the Master.\"","22":"Then the cherubim spread their wings, with the wheels beside them and the Glory of the God of Israel hovering over them.","23":"The Glory of GOD ascended from within the city and rested on the mountain to the east of the city. [JC]","24":"Then, still in the vision given me by the Spirit of God, the Spirit took me and carried me back to the exiles in Babylon. And then the vision left me.","25":"I told the exiles everything that GOD had shown me."}
