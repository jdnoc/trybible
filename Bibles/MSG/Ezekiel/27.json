A Lebanon cedar supplied your mast.","6":"They made your oars from sturdy Bashan oaks. Cypress from Cyprus inlaid with ivory was used for the decks.","7":"Your sail and flag were of colorful embroidered linen from Egypt. Your purple deck awnings also came from Cyprus.","8":"Men of Sidon and Arvad pulled the oars. Your seasoned seamen, O Tyre, were the crew.","9":"Ship's carpenters were old salts from Byblos. All the ships of the sea and their sailors clustered around you to barter for your goods.","10":"Your army was composed of soldiers from Paras, Lud, and Put, Elite troops in uniformed splendor. They put you on the map!","11":"Your city police were imported from Arvad, Helech, and Gammad. They hung their shields from the city walls, a final, perfect touch to your beauty.","12":"Tarshish carried on business with you because of your great wealth.

Oh, it was big business for you, trafficking the seaways!","26":"Your sailors row mightily, taking you into the high seas. Then a storm out of the east shatters your ship in the ocean deep.","27":"Everything sinks--your rich goods and products, sailors and crew, ship's carpenters and soldiers, Sink to the bottom of the sea. Total shipwreck.","28":"The cries of your sailors reverberate on shore.","29":"Sailors everywhere abandon ship. Veteran seamen swim for dry land.","30":"They cry out in grief, a choir of bitter lament over you. They smear their faces with ashes,","31":"shave their heads, Wear rough burlap, wildly keening their loss.","32":"They raise their funeral song: \"Who on the high seas is like Tyre!\"","33":"As you crisscrossed the seas with your products, you satisfied many peoples. Your worldwide trade made earth's kings rich.","34":"And now you're battered to bits by the waves, sunk to the bottom of the sea, And everything you've bought and sold has sunk to the bottom with you.","35":"Everyone on shore looks on in terror. The hair of kings stands on end, their faces drawn and haggard!","36":"The buyers and sellers of the world throw up their hands: This horror can't happen! Oh, this has happened!'\""}
