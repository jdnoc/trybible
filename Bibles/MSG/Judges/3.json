{"1":"These are the nations that GOD left there, using them to test the Israelites who had no experience in the Canaanite wars.","2":"He did it to train the descendants of Israel, the ones who had no battle experience, in the art of war.","3":"He left the five Philistine tyrants, all the Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the Hivites living on Mount Lebanon from Mount Baal Hermon to Hamath's Pass.","4":"They were there to test Israel and see whether they would obey GOD's commands that were given to their parents through Moses.","5":"But the People of Israel made themselves at home among the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites.","6":"They married their daughters and gave their own daughters to their sons in marriage. And they worshiped their gods.","7":"The People of Israel did evil in GOD's sight. They forgot their GOD and worshiped the Baal gods and Asherah goddesses.","8":"GOD's hot anger blazed against Israel. He sold them off to Cushan-Rishathaim king of Aram Naharaim. The People of Israel were in servitude to Cushan-Rishathaim for eight years.","9":"The People of Israel cried out to GOD and GOD raised up a savior who rescued them: Caleb's nephew Othniel, son of his younger brother Kenaz.The Spirit of GOD came on him and he rallied Israel. He went out to war and GOD gave him Cushan-Rishathaim king of Aram Naharaim. Othniel made short work of him.","10":null,"11":"The land was quiet for forty years. Then Othniel son of Kenaz died.","12":"But the People of Israel went back to doing evil in GOD's sight. So GOD made Eglon king of Moab a power against Israel because they did evil in GOD's sight.","13":"He recruited the Ammonites and Amalekites and went out and struck Israel. They took the City of Palms.","14":"The People of Israel were in servitude to Eglon fourteen years.","15":"The People of Israel cried out to GOD and GOD raised up for them a savior, Ehud son of Gera, a Benjaminite. He was left-handed. The People of Israel sent tribute by him to Eglon king of Moab.","16":"Ehud made himself a short two-edged sword and strapped it on his right thigh under his clothes.","17":"He presented the tribute to Eglon king of Moab. Eglon was grossly fat.","18":"After Ehud finished presenting the tribute, he went a little way with the men who had carried it.","19":"But when he got as far as the stone images near Gilgal, he went back and said, \"I have a private message for you, O king.\" The king told his servants, \"Leave.\" They all left.","20":"Ehud approached him--the king was now quite alone in his cool rooftop room--and said, \"I have a word of God for you.\" Eglon stood up from his throne.","21":"Ehud reached with his left hand and took his sword from his right thigh and plunged it into the king's big belly.","22":"Not only the blade but the hilt went in. The fat closed in over it so he couldn't pull it out.","23":"Ehud slipped out by way of the porch and shut and locked the doors of the rooftop room behind him.","24":"Then he was gone. When the servants came, they saw with surprise that the doors to the rooftop room were locked. They said, \"He's probably relieving himself in the restroom.\"","25":"They waited. And then they worried--no one was coming out of those locked doors. Finally, they got a key and unlocked them. There was their master, fallen on the floor, dead!","26":"While they were standing around wondering what to do, Ehud was long gone. He got past the stone images and escaped to Seirah.","27":"When he got there, he sounded the trumpet on Mount Ephraim. The People of Israel came down from the hills and joined him. He took his place at their head.","28":"He said, \"Follow me, for GOD has given your enemies--yes, Moab!-to you.\" They went down after him and secured the fords of the Jordan against the Moabites. They let no one cross over.","29":"At that time, they struck down about ten companies of Moabites, all of them well-fed and robust. Not one escaped.","30":"That day Moab was subdued under the hand of Israel. The land was quiet for eighty years.","31":"Shamgar son of Anath came after Ehud. Using a cattle prod, he killed six hundred Philistines single-handed. He too saved Israel."}
