{"1":"That will be the day when seven women will gang up on one man, saying, \"We'll take care of ourselves, get our own food and clothes. Just give us a child. Make us pregnant so we'll have something to live for!\"","2":"And that's when GOD's Branch will sprout green and lush. The produce of the country will give Israel's survivors something to be proud of again. Oh, they'll hold their heads high!","3":"Everyone left behind in Zion, all the discards and rejects in Jerusalem, will be reclassified as \"holy\"--alive and therefore precious.","4":"GOD will give Zion's women a good bath. He'll scrub the bloodstained city of its violence and brutality, purge the place with a firestorm of judgment.","5":"Then GOD will bring back the ancient pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night and mark Mount Zion and everyone in it with his glorious presence, his immense, protective presence,","6":"shade from the burning sun and shelter from the driving rain."}
