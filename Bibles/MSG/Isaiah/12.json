I trust, I won't be afraid. GOD-yes GOD!-is my strength and song, best of all, my salvation!\"","3":"Joyfully you'll pull up buckets of water from the wells of salvation.","4":"And as you do it, you'll say, \"Give thanks to GOD.

Let the whole earth know what he's done!","6":"Raise the roof! Sing your hearts out, O Zion! The Greatest lives among you: The Holy of Israel.\""}
