{"1":"There was a man from the tribe of Benjamin named Kish. He was the son of Abiel, grandson of Zeror, great-grandson of Becorath, great-great-grandson of Aphiah--a Benjaminite of stalwart character.","2":"He had a son, Saul, a most handsome young man. There was none finer--he literally stood head and shoulders above the crowd!","3":"Some of Kish's donkeys got lost. Kish said to his son, \"Saul, take one of the servants with you and go look for the donkeys.\"","4":"Saul took one of the servants and went to find the donkeys. They went into the hill country of Ephraim around Shalisha, but didn't find them. Then they went over to Shaalim--no luck. Then to Jabin, and still nothing.","5":"When they got to Zuph, Saul said to the young man with him, \"Enough of this. Let's go back. Soon my father is going to forget about the donkeys and start worrying about us.\"","6":"He replied, \"Not so fast. There's a holy man in this town. He carries a lot of weight around here. What he says is always right on the mark. Maybe he can tell us where to go.\"","7":"Saul said, \"If we go, what do we have to give him? There's no more bread in our sacks. We've nothing to bring as a gift to the holy man. Do we have anything else?\"","8":"The servant spoke up, \"Look, I just happen to have this silver coin! I'll give it to the holy man and he'll tell us how to proceed!\"","9":"(In former times in Israel, a person who wanted to seek God's word on a matter would say, \"Let's visit the Seer,\" because the one we now call \"the Prophet\" used to be called \"the Seer.\")","10":"\"Good,\" said Saul, \"let's go.\" And they set off for the town where the holy man lived.","11":"As they were climbing up the hill into the town, they met some girls who were coming out to draw water. They said to them, \"Is this where the Seer lives?\"","12":"They answered, \"It sure is--just ahead. Hurry up. He's come today because the people have prepared a sacrifice at the shrine.","13":"As soon as you enter the town, you can catch him before he goes up to the shrine to eat. The people won't eat until he arrives, for he has to bless the sacrifice. Only then can everyone eat. So get going. You're sure to find him!\"","14":"They continued their climb and entered the city. And then there he was--Samuel!-coming straight toward them on his way to the shrine!","15":"The very day before, GOD had confided in Samuel,","16":"\"This time tomorrow, I'm sending a man from the land of Benjamin to meet you. You're to anoint him as prince over my people Israel. He will free my people from Philistine oppression. Yes, I know all about their hard circumstances. I've heard their cries for help.\"","17":"The moment Samuel laid eyes on Saul, GOD said, \"He's the one, the man I told you about. This is the one who will keep my people in check.\"","18":"Saul came up to Samuel in the street and said, \"Pardon me, but can you tell me where the Seer lives?\"","19":"\"I'm the Seer,\" said Samuel. \"Accompany me to the shrine and eat with me. In the morning I'll tell you all about what's on your mind, and send you on your way.","20":"And by the way, your lost donkeys--the ones you've been hunting for the last three days--have been found, so don't worry about them. At this moment, Israel's future is in your hands.\"","21":"Saul answered, \"But I'm only a Benjaminite, from the smallest of Israel's tribes, and from the most insignificant clan in the tribe at that. Why are you talking to me like this?\"","22":"Samuel took Saul and his servant and led them into the dining hall at the shrine and seated them at the head of the table. There were about thirty guests.","23":"Then Samuel directed the chef, \"Bring the choice cut I pointed out to you, the one I told you to reserve.\"","24":"The chef brought it and placed it before Saul with a flourish, saying, \"This meal was kept aside just for you. Eat! It was especially prepared for this time and occasion with these guests.\" Saul ate with Samuel--a memorable day!","25":"Afterward they went down from the shrine into the city. A bed was prepared for Saul on the breeze-cooled roof of Samuel's house.","26":"They woke at the break of day. Samuel called to Saul on the roof, \"Get up and I'll send you off.\" Saul got up and the two of them went out in the street.","27":"As they approached the outskirts of town, Samuel said to Saul, \"Tell your servant to go on ahead of us. You stay with me for a bit. I have a word of God to give you.\""}
