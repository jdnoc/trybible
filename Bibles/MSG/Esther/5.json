{"1":"Three days later Esther dressed in her royal robes and took up a position in the inner court of the palace in front of the king's throne room. The king was on his throne facing the entrance.","2":"When he noticed Queen Esther standing in the court, he was pleased to see her; the king extended the gold scepter in his hand. Esther approached and touched the tip of the scepter.","3":"The king asked, \"And what's your desire, Queen Esther? What do you want? Ask and it's yours--even if it's half my kingdom!\"","4":"\"If it please the king,\" said Esther, \"let the king come with Haman to a dinner I've prepared for him.\"","5":"\"Get Haman at once,\" said the king, \"so we can go to dinner with Esther.\" So the king and Haman joined Esther at the dinner she had arranged.","6":"As they were drinking the wine, the king said, \"Now, what is it you want? Half of my kingdom isn't too much to ask! Just ask.\"","7":"Esther answered, \"Here's what I want.","8":"If the king favors me and is pleased to do what I desire and ask, let the king and Haman come again tomorrow to the dinner that I will fix for them. Then I'll give a straight answer to the king's question.\" W+","9":"Haman left the palace that day happy, beaming. And then he saw Mordecai sitting at the King's Gate ignoring him, oblivious to him. Haman was furious with Mordecai.","10":"But he held himself in and went on home. He got his friends together with his wife Zeresh","11":"and started bragging about how much money he had, his many sons, all the times the king had honored him, and his promotion to the highest position in the government.","12":"\"On top of all that,\" Haman continued, \"Queen Esther invited me to a private dinner she gave for the king, just the three of us. And she's invited me to another one tomorrow.","13":"But I can't enjoy any of it when I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the King's Gate.\"","14":"His wife Zeresh and all his friends said, \"Build a gallows seventy-five feet high. First thing in the morning speak with the king; get him to order Mordecai hanged on it. Then happily go with the king to dinner.\" Haman liked that. He had the gallows built. [JC]"}
