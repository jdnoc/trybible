She's helped many a person, including me.","3":"Say hello to Priscilla and Aquila, who have worked hand in hand with me in serving Jesus.","4":"They once put their lives on the line for me. And I'm not the only one grateful to them. All the non-Jewish gatherings of believers also owe them plenty,","5":"to say nothing of the church that meets in their house. Hello to my dear friend Epenetus. He was the very first Christian in the province of Asia.","6":"Hello to Mary. What a worker she has turned out to be!","7":"Hello to my cousins Andronicus and Junias. We once shared a jail cell. They were believers in Christ before I was.

Keep a sharp eye out for those who take bits and pieces of the teaching that you learned and then use them to make trouble. Give these people a wide berth.","18":"They have no intention of living for our Master Christ. They're only in this for what they can get out of it, and aren't above using pious sweet talk to dupe unsuspecting innocents.","19":"And so while there has never been any question about your honesty in these matters--I couldn't be more proud of you!-I want you also to be smart, making sure every \"good\" thing is the real thing. Don't be gullible in regard to smooth-talking evil. Stay alert like this,","20":"and before you know it the God of peace will come down on Satan with both feet, stomping him into the dirt.

Yes!"}
