Splash its blood against all sides of the Altar.","3":"Offer up all the fat: the fat tail, the fat covering the entrails,","4":"the two kidneys and the fat encasing them at the loins, and the lobe of the liver that is removed with the kidneys.","5":"The priest burns them on the Altar as a gift to GOD. It is a Compensation-Offering.","6":"Any male from among the priests' families may eat it. But it must be eaten in a holy place; it is most holy.","7":"\"The Compensation-Offering is the same as the Absolution-Offering--the same rules apply to both. The offering belongs to the priest who makes atonement with it.","8":"The priest who presents a Whole-Burnt-Offering for someone gets the hide for himself.","9":"Every Grain-Offering baked in an oven or prepared in a pan or on a griddle belongs to the priest who presents it. It's his.","10":"Every Grain-Offering, whether dry or mixed with oil, belongs equally to all the sons of Aaron.

It won't benefit him a bit--it has become defiled meat. And whoever eats it must take responsibility for his iniquity.","19":"Don't eat meat that has touched anything ritually unclean; burn it up. Any other meat can be eaten by those who are ritually clean.","20":"But if you're not ritually clean and eat meat from the Peace-Offering for GOD, you will be excluded from the congregation.","21":"And if you touch anything ritually unclean, whether human or animal uncleanness or an obscene object, and go ahead and eat from a Peace-Offering for GOD, you'll be excluded from the congregation.\" [JC]","22":"GOD spoke to Moses,","23":"\"Speak to the People of Israel. Tell them, Don't eat any fat of cattle or sheep or goats.","24":"The fat of an animal found dead or torn by wild animals can be put to some other purpose, but you may not eat it.","25":"If you eat fat from an animal from which a gift has been presented to GOD, you'll be excluded from the congregation.","26":"And don't eat blood, whether of birds or animals, no matter where you end up living.","27":"If you eat blood you'll be excluded from the congregation.\" [JC]","28":"GOD spoke to Moses,","29":"\"Speak to the People of Israel.

This is their fixed compensation from the People of Israel.\"","35":"From the day they are presented to serve as priests to GOD, Aaron and his sons can expect to receive these allotments from the gifts of GOD","36":"This is what GOD commanded the People of Israel to give the priests from the day of their anointing. This is the fixed rule down through the generations.","37":"These are the instructions for the Whole-Burnt-Offering, the Grain-Offering, the Absolution-Offering, the Compensation-Offering, the Ordination-Offering, and the Peace-Offering","38":"which GOD gave Moses at Mount Sinai on the day he commanded the People of Israel to present their offerings to GOD in the wilderness of Sinai."}
