{"1":"GOD spoke to Moses,","2":"\"Speak to the People of Israel. Tell them: I am GOD, your God.","3":"Don't live like the people of Egypt where you used to live, and don't live like the people of Canaan where I'm bringing you. Don't do what they do.","4":"Obey my laws and live by my decrees. I am your GOD.","5":"Keep my decrees and laws: The person who obeys them lives by them. I am GOD.","6":"\"Don't have sex with a close relative. I am GOD.","7":"\"Don't violate your father by having sex with your mother. She is your mother. Don't have sex with her.","8":"\"Don't have sex with your father's wife. That violates your father.","9":"\"Don't have sex with your sister, whether she's your father's daughter or your mother's, whether she was born in the same house or elsewhere.","10":"\"Don't have sex with your son's daughter or your daughter's daughter. That would violate your own body.","11":"\"Don't have sex with the daughter of your father's wife born to your father. She is your sister.","12":"\"Don't have sex with your father's sister; she is your aunt, closely related to your father.","13":"\"Don't have sex with your mother's sister; she is your aunt, closely related to your mother.","14":"\"Don't violate your father's brother, your uncle, by having sex with his wife.

I am GOD.","22":"\"Don't have sex with a man as one does with a woman. That is abhorrent.","23":"\"Don't have sex with an animal and violate yourself by it. \"A woman must not have sex with an animal. That is perverse.","24":"\"Don't pollute yourself in any of these ways. This is how the nations became polluted, the ones that I am going to drive out of the land before you.","25":"Even the land itself became polluted and I punished it for its iniquities--the land vomited up its inhabitants.","26":"You must keep my decrees and laws--natives and foreigners both. You must not do any of these abhorrent things.","27":"The people who lived in this land before you arrived did all these things and polluted the land.","28":"And if you pollute it, the land will vomit you up just as it vomited up the nations that preceded you.","29":"\"Those who do any of these abhorrent things will be cut off from their people.","30":"Keep to what I tell you; don't engage in any of the abhorrent acts that were practiced before you came. Don't pollute yourselves with them. I am GOD, your God.\""}
