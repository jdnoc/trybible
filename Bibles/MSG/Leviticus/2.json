{"1":"\"When you present a Grain-Offering to GOD, use fine flour. Pour oil on it, put incense on it,","2":"and bring it to Aaron's sons, the priests. One of them will take a handful of the fine flour and oil, with all the incense, and burn it on the Altar for a memorial: a Fire-Gift, a pleasing fragrance to GOD.","3":"The rest of the Grain-Offering is for Aaron and his sons--a most holy part of the Fire-Gifts to GOD.","4":"\"When you present a Grain-Offering of oven-baked loaves, use fine flour, mixed with oil but no yeast.

Don't leave the salt of the covenant with your God out of your Grain-Offerings.
