{"1":"I'm the man who has seen trouble, trouble coming from the lash of GOD's anger.","2":"He took me by the hand and walked me into pitch-black darkness.","3":"Yes, he's given me the back of his hand over and over and over again.","4":"He turned me into a scarecrow of skin and bones, then broke the bones.","5":"He hemmed me in, ganged up on me, poured on the trouble and hard times.","6":"He locked me up in deep darkness, like a corpse nailed inside a coffin.","7":"He shuts me in so I'll never get out, manacles my hands, shackles my feet.","8":"Even when I cry out and plead for help, he locks up my prayers and throws away the key.","9":"He sets up blockades with quarried limestone. He's got me cornered.","10":"He's a prowling bear tracking me down, a lion in hiding ready to pounce.","11":"He knocked me from the path and ripped me to pieces. When he finished, there was nothing left of me.","12":"He took out his bow and arrows and used me for target practice.","13":"He shot me in the stomach with arrows from his quiver.","14":"Everyone took me for a joke, made me the butt of their mocking ballads.","15":"He forced rotten, stinking food down my throat, bloated me with vile drinks.","16":"He ground my face into the gravel. He pounded me into the mud.","17":"I gave up on life altogether. I've forgotten what the good life is like.","18":"I said to myself, \"This is it. I'm finished. GOD is a lost cause.\"","19":"I'll never forget the trouble, the utter lostness, the taste of ashes, the poison I've swallowed.","20":"I remember it all--oh, how well I remember--the feeling of hitting the bottom.","21":"But there's one other thing I remember, and remembering, I keep a grip on hope:","22":"GOD's loyal love couldn't have run out, his merciful love couldn't have dried up.","23":"They're created new every morning. How great your faithfulness!","24":"I'm sticking with GOD (I say it over and over). He's all I've got left.","25":"GOD proves to be good to the man who passionately waits, to the woman who diligently seeks.","26":"It's a good thing to quietly hope, quietly hope for help from GOD.","27":"It's a good thing when you're young to stick it out through the hard times.","28":"When life is heavy and hard to take, go off by yourself. Enter the silence.","29":"Bow in prayer. Don't ask questions: Wait for hope to appear.","30":"Don't run from trouble. Take it full-face. The \"worst\" is never the worst.","31":"Why? Because the Master won't ever walk out and fail to return.","32":"If he works severely, he also works tenderly. His stockpiles of loyal love are immense.","33":"He takes no pleasure in making life hard, in throwing roadblocks in the way:","34":"Stomping down hard on luckless prisoners,","35":"Refusing justice to victims in the court of High God,","36":"Tampering with evidence--the Master does not approve of such things.","37":"Who do you think \"spoke and it happened\"? It's the Master who gives such orders.","38":"Doesn't the High God speak everything, good things and hard things alike, into being?","39":"And why would anyone gifted with life complain when punished for sin?","40":"Let's take a good look at the way we're living and reorder our lives under GOD.","41":"Let's lift our hearts and hands at one and the same time, praying to God in heaven:","42":"\"We've been contrary and willful, and you haven't forgiven.","43":"\"You lost your temper with us, holding nothing back. You chased us and cut us down without mercy.","44":"You wrapped yourself in thick blankets of clouds so no prayers could get through.","45":"You treated us like dirty dishwater, threw us out in the backyard of the nations.","46":"\"Our enemies shout abuse, their mouths full of derision, spitting invective.","47":"We've been to hell and back. We've nowhere to turn, nowhere to go.","48":"Rivers of tears pour from my eyes at the smashup of my dear people.","49":"\"The tears stream from my eyes, an artesian well of tears,","50":"Until you, GOD, look down from on high, look and see my tears.","51":"When I see what's happened to the young women in the city, the pain breaks my heart.","52":"\"Enemies with no reason to be enemies hunted me down like a bird.","53":"They threw me into a pit, then pelted me with stones.","54":"Then the rains came and filled the pit. The water rose over my head. I said, \"It's all over.'","55":"\"I called out your name, O GOD, called from the bottom of the pit.","56":"You listened when I called out, \"Don't shut your ears! Get me out of here! Save me!'","57":"You came close when I called out. You said, \"It's going to be all right.'","58":"\"You took my side, Master; you brought me back alive!","59":"GOD, you saw the wrongs heaped on me. Give me my day in court!","60":"Yes, you saw their mean-minded schemes, their plots to destroy me.","61":"\"You heard, GOD, their vicious gossip, their behind-my-back plots to ruin me.","62":"They never quit, these enemies of mine, dreaming up mischief, hatching out malice, day after day after day.","63":"Sitting down or standing up--just look at them!- they mock me with vulgar doggerel.","64":"\"Make them pay for what they've done, GOD. Give them their just deserts.","65":"Break their miserable hearts! Damn their eyes!","66":"Get good and angry. Hunt them down. Make a total demolition here under your heaven!\""}
