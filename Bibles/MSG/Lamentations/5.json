{"1":"\"Remember, GOD, all we've been through. Study our plight, the black mark we've made in history.","2":"Our precious land has been given to outsiders, our homes to strangers.","3":"Orphans we are, not a father in sight, and our mothers no better than widows.","4":"We have to pay to drink our own water. Even our firewood comes at a price.","5":"We're nothing but slaves, bullied and bowed, worn out and without any rest.","6":"We sold ourselves to Assyria and Egypt just to get something to eat.","7":"Our parents sinned and are no more, and now we're paying for the wrongs they did.","8":"Slaves rule over us; there's no escape from their grip.","9":"We risk our lives to gather food in the bandit-infested desert.","10":"Our skin has turned black as an oven, dried out like old leather from the famine.","11":"Our wives were raped in the streets in Zion, and our virgins in the cities of Judah.","12":"They hanged our princes by their hands, dishonored our elders.","13":"Strapping young men were put to women's work, mere boys forced to do men's work.","14":"The city gate is empty of wise elders. Music from the young is heard no more.","15":"All the joy is gone from our hearts. Our dances have turned into dirges.","16":"The crown of glory has toppled from our head. Woe! Woe! Would that we'd never sinned!","17":"Because of all this we're heartsick; we can't see through the tears.","18":"On Mount Zion, wrecked and ruined, jackals pace and prowl.","19":"And yet, GOD, you're sovereign still, your throne intact and eternal.","20":"So why do you keep forgetting us? Why dump us and leave us like this?","21":"Bring us back to you, GOD-we're ready to come back. Give us a fresh start.","22":"As it is, you've cruelly disowned us. You've been so very angry with us.\""}
