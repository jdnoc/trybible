{"1":"Hallelujah! Praise GOD from heaven, praise him from the mountaintops;","2":"Praise him, all you his angels, praise him, all you his warriors,","3":"Praise him, sun and moon, praise him, you morning stars;","4":"Praise him, high heaven, praise him, heavenly rain clouds;","5":"Praise, oh let them praise the name of GOD- he spoke the word, and there they were!","6":"He set them in place from all time to eternity; He gave his orders, and that's it!","7":"Praise GOD from earth, you sea dragons, you fathomless ocean deeps;","8":"Fire and hail, snow and ice, hurricanes obeying his orders;","9":"Mountains and all hills, apple orchards and cedar forests;","10":"Wild beasts and herds of cattle, snakes, and birds in flight;","11":"Earth's kings and all races, leaders and important people,","12":"Robust men and women in their prime, and yes, graybeards and little children.","13":"Let them praise the name of GOD- it's the only Name worth praising. His radiance exceeds anything in earth and sky;","14":"he's built a monument--his very own people! Praise from all who love GOD! Israel's children, intimate friends of GOD. Hallelujah! al"}
