{"1":"I cry out loudly to GOD, loudly I plead with GOD for mercy.","2":"I spill out all my complaints before him, and spell out my troubles in detail:","3":"\"As I sink in despair, my spirit ebbing away, you know how I'm feeling, Know the danger I'm in, the traps hidden in my path.","4":"Look right, look left--there's not a soul who cares what happens! I'm up against it, with no exit--bereft, left alone.","5":"I cry out, GOD, call out: \"You're my last chance, my only hope for life!'","6":"Oh listen, please listen; I've never been this low. Rescue me from those who are hunting me down; I'm no match for them.","7":"Get me out of this dungeon so I can thank you in public. Your people will form a circle around me and you'll bring me showers of blessing!\""}
