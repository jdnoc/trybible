{"1":"I've already run for dear life straight to the arms of GOD. So why would I run away now when you say, \"Run to the mountains;","2":"the evil bows are bent, the wicked arrows Aimed to shoot under cover of darkness at every heart open to God.","3":"The bottom's dropped out of the country; good people don't have a chance\"?","4":"But GOD hasn't moved to the mountains; his holy address hasn't changed. He's in charge, as always, his eyes taking everything in, his eyelids Unblinking, examining Adam's unruly brood inside and out, not missing a thing.","5":"He tests the good and the bad alike; if anyone cheats, God's outraged.","6":"Fail the test and you're out, out in a hail of firestones, Drinking from a canteen filled with hot desert wind.","7":"GOD's business is putting things right; he loves getting the lines straight, Setting us straight. Once we're standing tall, we can look him straight in the eye."}
