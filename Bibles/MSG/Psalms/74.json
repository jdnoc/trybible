{"1":"You walked off and left us, and never looked back. God, how could you do that? We're your very own sheep; how can you stomp off in anger?","2":"Refresh your memory of us--you bought us a long time ago. Your most precious tribe--you paid a good price for us! Your very own Mount Zion--you actually lived here once!","3":"Come and visit the site of disaster, see how they've wrecked the sanctuary.","4":"While your people were at worship, your enemies barged in, brawling and scrawling graffiti.","5":"They set fire to the porch; axes swinging, they chopped up the woodwork,","6":"Beat down the doors with sledgehammers, then split them into kindling.","7":"They burned your holy place to the ground, violated the place of worship.","8":"They said to themselves, \"We'll wipe them all out,\" and burned down all the places of worship.","9":"There's not a sign or symbol of God in sight, nor anyone to speak in his name, no one who knows what's going on.","10":"How long, God, will barbarians blaspheme, enemies curse and get by with it?","11":"Why don't you do something? How long are you going to sit there with your hands folded in your lap?","12":"God is my King from the very start; he works salvation in the womb of the earth.","13":"With one blow you split the sea in two, you made mincemeat of the dragon Tannin.","14":"You lopped off the heads of Leviathan, then served them up in a stew for the animals.","15":"With your finger you opened up springs and creeks, and dried up the wild floodwaters.","16":"You own the day, you own the night; you put stars and sun in place.","17":"You laid out the four corners of earth, shaped the seasons of summer and winter.","18":"Mark and remember, GOD, all the enemy taunts, each idiot desecration.","19":"Don't throw your lambs to the wolves; after all we've been through, don't forget us.","20":"Remember your promises; the city is in darkness, the countryside violent.","21":"Don't leave the victims to rot in the street; make them a choir that sings your praises.","22":"On your feet, O God--stand up for yourself! Do you hear what they're saying about you, all the vile obscenities?","23":"Don't tune out their malicious filth, the brawling invective that never lets up. An Asaph psalm"}
