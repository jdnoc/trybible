{"1":"GOD, my shepherd! I don't need a thing.","2":"You have bedded me down in lush meadows, you find me quiet pools to drink from.","3":"True to your word, you let me catch my breath and send me in the right direction.","4":"Even when the way goes through Death Valley, I'm not afraid when you walk at my side. Your trusty shepherd's crook makes me feel secure.","5":"You serve me a six-course dinner right in front of my enemies. You revive my drooping head; my cup brims with blessing.","6":"Your beauty and love chase after me every day of my life. I'm back home in the house of GOD for the rest of my life."}
