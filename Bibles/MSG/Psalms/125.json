{"1":"Those who trust in GOD are like Zion Mountain: Nothing can move it, a rock-solid mountain you can always depend on.","2":"Mountains encircle Jerusalem, and GOD encircles his people--always has and always will.","3":"The fist of the wicked will never violate What is due the righteous, provoking wrongful violence.","4":"Be good to your good people, GOD, to those whose hearts are right!","5":"GOD will round up the backsliders, corral them with the incorrigibles. Peace over Israel!"}
