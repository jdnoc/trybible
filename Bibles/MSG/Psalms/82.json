{"1":"God calls the judges into his courtroom, he puts all the judges in the dock.","2":"\"Enough! You've corrupted justice long enough, you've let the wicked get away with murder.","3":"You're here to defend the defenseless, to make sure that underdogs get a fair break;","4":"Your job is to stand up for the powerless, and prosecute all those who exploit them.\"","5":"Ignorant judges! Head-in-the-sand judges! They haven't a clue to what's going on. And now everything's falling apart, the world's coming unglued.","6":"\"I commissioned you judges, each one of you, deputies of the High God,","7":"But you've betrayed your commission and now you're stripped of your rank, busted.\"","8":"O God, give them their just deserts! You've got the whole world in your hands! An Asaph psalm"}
