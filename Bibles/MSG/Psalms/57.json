{"1":"Be good to me, God--and now! I've run to you for dear life. I'm hiding out under your wings until the hurricane blows over.","2":"I call out to High God, the God who holds me together.","3":"He sends orders from heaven and saves me, he humiliates those who kick me around. God delivers generous love, he makes good on his word.","4":"I find myself in a pride of lions who are wild for a taste of human flesh; Their teeth are lances and arrows, their tongues are sharp daggers.","5":"Soar high in the skies, O God! Cover the whole earth with your glory!","6":"They booby trapped my path; I thought I was dead and done for. They dug a mantrap to catch me, and fell in headlong themselves.","7":"I'm ready, God, so ready, ready from head to toe, Ready to sing, ready to raise a tune:","8":"\"Wake up, soul! Wake up, harp! wake up, lute! Wake up, you sleepyhead sun!\"","9":"I'm thanking you, GOD, out loud in the streets, singing your praises in town and country.","10":"The deeper your love, the higher it goes; every cloud is a flag to your faithfulness.","11":"Soar high in the skies, O God! Cover the whole earth with your glory!"}
