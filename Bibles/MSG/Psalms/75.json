{"1":"We thank you, God, we thank you--your Name is our favorite word; your mighty works are all we talk about.","2":"You say, \"I'm calling this meeting to order, I'm ready to set things right.","3":"When the earth goes topsy-turvy And nobody knows which end is up, I nail it all down, I put everything in place again.","4":"I say to the smart alecks, \"That's enough,' to the bullies, \"Not so fast.'\"","5":"Don't raise your fist against High God. Don't raise your voice against Rock of Ages.","6":"He's the One from east to west; from desert to mountains, he's the One.","7":"God rules: he brings this one down to his knees, pulls that one up on her feet.","8":"GOD has a cup in his hand, a bowl of wine, full to the brim. He draws from it and pours; it's drained to the dregs. Earth's wicked ones drink it all, drink it down to the last bitter drop!","9":"And I'm telling the story of God Eternal, singing the praises of Jacob's God.","10":"The fists of the wicked are bloody stumps, The arms of the righteous are lofty green branches. An Asaph psalm"}
