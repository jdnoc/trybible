{"1":"GOD! GOD! I am running to you for dear life; the chase is wild.","2":"If they catch me, I'm finished: ripped to shreds by foes fierce as lions, dragged into the forest and left unlooked for, unremembered.","3":"GOD, if I've done what they say--","4":"betrayed my friends, ripped off my enemies--If my hands are really that dirty,","5":"let them get me, walk all over me, leave me flat on my face in the dirt.","6":"Stand up, GOD; pit your holy fury against my furious enemies. Wake up, God.","7":"My accusers have packed the courtroom; it's judgment time.","8":"Take your place on the bench, reach for your gavel, throw out the false charges against me. I'm ready, confident in your verdict: \"Innocent.\"","9":"Close the book on Evil, GOD, but publish your mandate for us. You get us ready for life: you probe for our soft spots, you knock off our rough edges.","10":"And I'm feeling so fit, so safe: made right, kept right.","11":"God in solemn honor does things right, but his nerves are sandpapered raw. Nobody gets by with anything.","12":"God is already in action--Sword honed on his whetstone, bow strung, arrow on the string,","13":"Lethal weapons in hand, each arrow a flaming missile.","14":"Look at that guy! He had sex with sin, he's pregnant with evil. Oh, look! He's having the baby--a Lie-Baby!","15":"See that man shoveling day after day, digging, then concealing, his man-trap down that lonely stretch of road? Go back and look again--you'll see him in it headfirst, legs waving in the breeze.","16":"That's what happens: mischief backfires; violence boomerangs.","17":"I'm thanking God, who makes things right. I'm singing the fame of heaven-high GOD."}
