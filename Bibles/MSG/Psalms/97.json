{"1":"GOD rules: there's something to shout over! On the double, mainlands and islands--celebrate!","2":"Bright clouds and storm clouds circle 'round him; Right and justice anchor his rule.","3":"Fire blazes out before him, Flaming high up the craggy mountains.","4":"His lightnings light up the world; Earth, wide-eyed, trembles in fear.","5":"The mountains take one look at GOD And melt, melt like wax before earth's Lord.","6":"The heavens announce that he'll set everything right, And everyone will see it happen--glorious!","7":"All who serve handcrafted gods will be sorry--And they were so proud of their ragamuffin gods! On your knees, all you gods--worship him!","8":"And Zion, you listen and take heart! Daughters of Zion, sing your hearts out: GOD has done it all, has set everything right.","9":"You, GOD, are High God of the cosmos, Far, far higher than any of the gods.","10":"GOD loves all who hate evil, And those who love him he keeps safe, Snatches them from the grip of the wicked.","11":"Light-seeds are planted in the souls of God's people, Joy-seeds are planted in good heart-soil.","12":"So, God's people, shout praise to GOD, Give thanks to our Holy God!"}
