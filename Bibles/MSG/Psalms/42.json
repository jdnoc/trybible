{"1":"A white-tailed deer drinks from the creek; I want to drink God, deep draughts of God.","2":"I'm thirsty for God--alive. I wonder, \"Will I ever make it--arrive and drink in God's presence?\"","3":"I'm on a diet of tears--tears for breakfast, tears for supper. All day long people knock at my door, Pestering, \"Where is this God of yours?\"","4":"These are the things I go over and over, emptying out the pockets of my life. I was always at the head of the worshiping crowd, right out in front, Leading them all, eager to arrive and worship, Shouting praises, singing thanksgiving--celebrating, all of us, God's feast!","5":"Why are you down in the dumps, dear soul? Why are you crying the blues? Fix my eyes on God--soon I'll be praising again. He puts a smile on my face. He's my God.","6":"When my soul is in the dumps, I rehearse everything I know of you, From Jordan depths to Hermon heights, including Mount Mizar.","7":"Chaos calls to chaos, to the tune of whitewater rapids. Your breaking surf, your thundering breakers crash and crush me.","8":"Then GOD promises to love me all day, sing songs all through the night! My life is God's prayer.","9":"Sometimes I ask God, my rock-solid God, \"Why did you let me down? Why am I walking around in tears, harassed by enemies?\"","10":"They're out for the kill, these tormentors with their obscenities, Taunting day after day, \"Where is this God of yours?\"","11":"Why are you down in the dumps, dear soul? Why are you crying the blues? Fix my eyes on God--soon I'll be praising again. He puts a smile on my face. He's my God."}
