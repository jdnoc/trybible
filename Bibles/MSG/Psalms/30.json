{"1":"I give you all the credit, GOD- you got me out of that mess, you didn't let my foes gloat.","2":"GOD, my God, I yelled for help and you put me together.","3":"GOD, you pulled me out of the grave, gave me another chance at life when I was down--and-out.","4":"All you saints! Sing your hearts out to GOD! Thank him to his face!","5":"He gets angry once in a while, but across a lifetime there is only love. The nights of crying your eyes out give way to days of laughter.","6":"When things were going great I crowed, \"I've got it made.","7":"I'm GOD's favorite. He made me king of the mountain.\" Then you looked the other way and I fell to pieces.","8":"I called out to you, GOD; I laid my case before you:","9":"\"Can you sell me for a profit when I'm dead? auction me off at a cemetery yard sale? When I'm \"dust to dust' my songs and stories of you won't sell.","10":"So listen! and be kind! Help me out of this!\"","11":"You did it: you changed wild lament into whirling dance; You ripped off my black mourning band and decked me with wildflowers.","12":"I'm about to burst with song; I can't keep quiet about you. GOD, my God, I can't thank you enough."}
