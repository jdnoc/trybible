{"1":"Bend an ear, GOD; answer me. I'm one miserable wretch!","2":"Keep me safe--haven't I lived a good life? Help your servant--I'm depending on you!","3":"You're my God; have mercy on me. I count on you from morning to night.","4":"Give your servant a happy life; I put myself in your hands!","5":"You're well-known as good and forgiving, bighearted to all who ask for help.","6":"Pay attention, GOD, to my prayer; bend down and listen to my cry for help.","7":"Every time I'm in trouble I call on you, confident that you'll answer.","8":"There's no one quite like you among the gods, O Lord, and nothing to compare with your works.","9":"All the nations you made are on their way, ready to give honor to you, O Lord, Ready to put your beauty on display,","10":"parading your greatness, And the great things you do--God, you're the one, there's no one but you!","11":"Train me, GOD, to walk straight; then I'll follow your true path. Put me together, one heart and mind; then, undivided, I'll worship in joyful fear.","12":"From the bottom of my heart I thank you, dear Lord; I've never kept secret what you're up to.","13":"You've always been great toward me--what love! You snatched me from the brink of disaster!","14":"God, these bullies have reared their heads! A gang of thugs is after me--and they don't care a thing about you.","15":"But you, O God, are both tender and kind, not easily angered, immense in love, and you never, never quit.","16":"So look me in the eye and show kindness, give your servant the strength to go on, save your dear, dear child!","17":"Make a show of how much you love me so the bullies who hate me will stand there slack-jawed, As you, GOD, gently and powerfully put me back on my feet.
