Then your people will laugh and sing!","7":"Show us how much you love us, GOD! Give us the salvation we need!","8":"I can't wait to hear what he'll say. GOD's about to pronounce his people well, The holy people he loves so much, so they'll never again live like fools.","9":"See how close his salvation is to those who fear him? Our country is home base for Glory!","10":"Love and Truth meet in the street, Right Living and Whole Living embrace and kiss!","11":"Truth sprouts green from the ground, Right Living pours down from the skies!","12":"Oh yes!
