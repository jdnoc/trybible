{"1":"GOD, I'm not trying to rule the roost, I don't want to be king of the mountain. I haven't meddled where I have no business or fantasized grandiose plans.","2":"I've kept my feet on the ground, I've cultivated a quiet heart. Like a baby content in its mother's arms, my soul is a baby content.","3":"Wait, Israel, for GOD. Wait with hope. Hope now; hope always!"}
