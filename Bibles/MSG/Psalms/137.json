{"1":"Alongside Babylon's rivers we sat on the banks; we cried and cried, remembering the good old days in Zion.","2":"Alongside the quaking aspens we stacked our unplayed harps;","3":"That's where our captors demanded songs, sarcastic and mocking: \"Sing us a happy Zion song!\"","4":"Oh, how could we ever sing GOD's song in this wasteland?","5":"If I ever forget you, Jerusalem, let my fingers wither and fall off like leaves.","6":"Let my tongue swell and turn black if I fail to remember you, If I fail, O dear Jerusalem, to honor you as my greatest.","7":"GOD, remember those Edomites, and remember the ruin of Jerusalem, That day they yelled out, \"Wreck it, smash it to bits!\"","8":"And you, Babylonians--ravagers! A reward to whoever gets back at you for all you've done to us;","9":"Yes, a reward to the one who grabs your babies and smashes their heads on the rocks!"}
