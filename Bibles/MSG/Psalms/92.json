{"1":"What a beautiful thing, GOD, to give thanks, to sing an anthem to you, the High God!","2":"To announce your love each daybreak, sing your faithful presence all through the night,","3":"Accompanied by dulcimer and harp, the full-bodied music of strings.","4":"You made me so happy, GOD. I saw your work and I shouted for joy.","5":"How magnificent your work, GOD! How profound your thoughts!","6":"Dullards never notice what you do; fools never do get it.","7":"When the wicked popped up like weeds and all the evil men and women took over, You mowed them down, finished them off once and for all.","8":"You, GOD, are High and Eternal.","9":"Look at your enemies, GOD! Look at your enemies--ruined! Scattered to the winds, all those hirelings of evil!","10":"But you've made me strong as a charging bison, you've honored me with a festive parade.","11":"The sight of my critics going down is still fresh, the rout of my malicious detractors. My ears are filled with the sounds of promise:","12":"\"Good people will prosper like palm trees, Grow tall like Lebanon cedars;","13":"transplanted to GOD's courtyard, They'll grow tall in the presence of God,","14":"lithe and green, virile still in old age.\"","15":"Such witnesses to upright GOD! My Mountain, my huge, holy Mountain!"}
