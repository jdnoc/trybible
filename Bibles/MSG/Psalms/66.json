{"1":"All together now--applause for God!","2":"Sing songs to the tune of his glory, set glory to the rhythms of his praise.","3":"Say of God, \"We've never seen anything like him!\" When your enemies see you in action, they slink off like scolded dogs.","4":"The whole earth falls to its knees--it worships you, sings to you, can't stop enjoying your name and fame.","5":"Take a good look at God's wonders--they'll take your breath away.","6":"He converted sea to dry land; travelers crossed the river on foot. Now isn't that cause for a song?","7":"Ever sovereign in his high tower, he keeps his eye on the godless nations. Rebels don't dare raise a finger against him.","8":"Bless our God, O peoples! Give him a thunderous welcome!","9":"Didn't he set us on the road to life? Didn't he keep us out of the ditch?","10":"He trained us first, passed us like silver through refining fires,","11":"Brought us into hardscrabble country, pushed us to our very limit,","12":"Road-tested us inside and out, took us to hell and back; Finally he brought us to this well-watered place.","13":"I'm bringing my prizes and presents to your house. I'm doing what I said I'd do,","14":"What I solemnly swore I'd do that day when I was in so much trouble:","15":"The choicest cuts of meat for the sacrificial meal; Even the fragrance of roasted lamb is like a meal! Or make it an ox garnished with goat meat!","16":"All believers, come here and listen, let me tell you what God did for me.","17":"I called out to him with my mouth, my tongue shaped the sounds of music.","18":"If I had been cozy with evil, the Lord would never have listened.","19":"But he most surely did listen, he came on the double when he heard my prayer.","20":"Blessed be God: he didn't turn a deaf ear, he stayed with me, loyal in his love."}
