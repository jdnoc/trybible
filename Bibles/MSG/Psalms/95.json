{"1":"Come, let's shout praises to GOD, raise the roof for the Rock who saved us!","2":"Let's march into his presence singing praises, lifting the rafters with our hymns!","3":"And why? Because GOD is the best, High King over all the gods.","4":"In one hand he holds deep caves and caverns, in the other hand grasps the high mountains.","5":"He made Ocean--he owns it! His hands sculpted Earth!","6":"So come, let us worship: bow before him, on your knees before GOD, who made us!","7":"Oh yes, he's our God, and we're the people he pastures, the flock he feeds. Drop everything and listen, listen as he speaks:","8":"\"Don't turn a deaf ear as in the Bitter Uprising, As on the day of the Wilderness Test,","9":"when your ancestors turned and put me to the test.","10":"For forty years they watched me at work among them, as over and over they tried my patience. And I was provoked--oh, was I provoked! \"Can't they keep their minds on God for five minutes? Do they simply refuse to walk down my road?'","11":"Exasperated, I exploded, \"They'll never get where they're headed, never be able to sit down and rest.'\""}
