{"1":"My God! Rescue me from my enemies, defend me from these mutineers.","2":"Rescue me from their dirty tricks, save me from their hit men.","3":"Desperadoes have ganged up on me, they're hiding in ambush for me. I did nothing to deserve this, GOD,","4":"crossed no one, wronged no one. All the same, they're after me, determined to get me. Wake up and see for yourself!","5":"You're GOD, God of angel armies, Israel's God! Get on the job and take care of these pagans, don't be soft on these hard cases.","6":"They return when the sun goes down, They howl like coyotes, ringing the city.","7":"Then suddenly they're all at the gate, Snarling invective, drawn daggers in their teeth. They think they'll never get caught.","8":"But you, GOD, break out laughing; you treat the godless nations like jokes.","9":"Strong God, I'm watching you do it, I can always count on you.","10":"God in dependable love shows up on time, shows me my enemies in ruin.","11":"Don't make quick work of them, GOD, lest my people forget. Bring them down in slow motion, take them apart piece by piece.","12":"Let all their mean-mouthed arrogance catch up with them, Catch them out and bring them down -every muttered curse -every barefaced lie.","13":"Finish them off in fine style! Finish them off for good! Then all the world will see that God rules well in Jacob, everywhere that God's in charge.","14":"They return when the sun goes down, They howl like coyotes, ringing the city.","15":"They scavenge for bones, And bite the hand that feeds them.","16":"And me? I'm singing your prowess, shouting at cockcrow your largesse, For you've been a safe place for me, a good place to hide.","17":"Strong God, I'm watching you do it, I can always count on you--God, my dependable love."}
