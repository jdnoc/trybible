{"1":"Take my side, God--I'm getting kicked around, stomped on every day.","2":"Not a day goes by but somebody beats me up; They make it their duty to beat me up.","3":"When I get really afraid I come to you in trust.","4":"I'm proud to praise God; fearless now, I trust in God. What can mere mortals do?","5":"They don't let up--they smear my reputation and huddle to plot my collapse.","6":"They gang up, sneak together through the alleys To take me by surprise, wait their chance to get me.","7":"Pay them back in evil! Get angry, God! Down with these people!","8":"You've kept track of my every toss and turn through the sleepless nights, Each tear entered in your ledger, each ache written in your book.","9":"If my enemies run away, turn tail when I yell at them, Then I'll know that God is on my side.","10":"I'm proud to praise God, proud to praise GOD.","11":"Fearless now, I trust in God; what can mere mortals do to me?","12":"God, you did everything you promised, and I'm thanking you with all my heart.","13":"You pulled me from the brink of death, my feet from the cliff-edge of doom. Now I stroll at leisure with God in the sunlit fields of life."}
