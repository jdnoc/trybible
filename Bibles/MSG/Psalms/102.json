{"1":"GOD, listen! Listen to my prayer, listen to the pain in my cries.","2":"Don't turn your back on me just when I need you so desperately. Pay attention! This is a cry for help! And hurry--this can't wait!","3":"I'm wasting away to nothing, I'm burning up with fever.","4":"I'm a ghost of my former self, half-consumed already by terminal illness.","5":"My jaws ache from gritting my teeth; I'm nothing but skin and bones.","6":"I'm like a buzzard in the desert, a crow perched on the rubble.","7":"Insomniac, I twitter away, mournful as a sparrow in the gutter.","8":"All day long my enemies taunt me, while others just curse.","9":"They bring in meals--casseroles of ashes! I draw drink from a barrel of my tears.","10":"And all because of your furious anger; you swept me up and threw me out.","11":"There's nothing left of me--a withered weed, swept clean from the path.","12":"Yet you, GOD, are sovereign still, always and ever sovereign.","13":"You'll get up from your throne and help Zion--it's time for compassionate help.","14":"Oh, how your servants love this city's rubble and weep with compassion over its dust!","15":"The godless nations will sit up and take notice -see your glory, worship your name--","16":"When GOD rebuilds Zion, when he shows up in all his glory,","17":"When he attends to the prayer of the wretched. He won't dismiss their prayer.","18":"Write this down for the next generation so people not yet born will praise GOD:","19":"\"GOD looked out from his high holy place; from heaven he surveyed the earth.","20":"He listened to the groans of the doomed, he opened the doors of their death cells.\"","21":"Write it so the story can be told in Zion, so GOD's praise will be sung in Jerusalem's streets","22":"And wherever people gather together along with their rulers to worship him.","23":"GOD sovereignly brought me to my knees, he cut me down in my prime.","24":"\"Oh, don't,\" I prayed, \"please don't let me die. You have more years than you know what to do with!","25":"You laid earth's foundations a long time ago, and handcrafted the very heavens;","26":"You'll still be around when they're long gone, threadbare and discarded like an old suit of clothes. You'll throw them away like a worn-out coat,","27":"but year after year you're as good as new.","28":"Your servants' children will have a good place to live and their children will be at home with you.\""}
