{"1":"God is well-known in Judah; in Israel, he's a household name.","2":"He keeps a house in Salem, his own suite of rooms in Zion.","3":"That's where, using arrows for kindling, he made a bonfire of weapons of war.","4":"Oh, how bright you shine! Outshining their huge piles of loot!","5":"The warriors were plundered and left there impotent. And now there's nothing to them, nothing to show for their swagger and threats.","6":"Your sudden roar, God of Jacob, knocked the wind out of horse and rider.","7":"Fierce you are, and fearsome! Who can stand up to your rising anger?","8":"From heaven you thunder judgment; earth falls to her knees and holds her breath.","9":"God stands tall and makes things right, he saves all the wretched on earth.","10":"Instead of smoldering rage--God--praise! All that sputtering rage--now a garland for God!","11":"Do for GOD what you said you'd do--he is, after all, your God. Let everyone in town bring offerings to the One Who Watches our every move.","12":"Nobody gets by with anything, no one plays fast and loose with him. An Asaph psalm"}
