{"1":"God--you're my God! I can't get enough of you! I've worked up such hunger and thirst for God, traveling across dry and weary deserts.","2":"So here I am in the place of worship, eyes open, drinking in your strength and glory.","3":"In your generous love I am really living at last! My lips brim praises like fountains.","4":"I bless you every time I take a breath; My arms wave like banners of praise to you.","5":"I eat my fill of prime rib and gravy; I smack my lips. It's time to shout praises!","6":"If I'm sleepless at midnight, I spend the hours in grateful reflection.","7":"Because you've always stood up for me, I'm free to run and play.","8":"I hold on to you for dear life, and you hold me steady as a post.","9":"Those who are out to get me are marked for doom, marked for death, bound for hell.","10":"They'll die violent deaths; jackals will tear them limb from limb.","11":"But the king is glad in God; his true friends spread the joy, While small-minded gossips are gagged for good."}
