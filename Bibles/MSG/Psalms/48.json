{"1":"GOD majestic, praise abounds in our God--city! His sacred mountain,","2":"breathtaking in its heights--earth's joy. Zion Mountain looms in the North, city of the world-King.","3":"God in his citadel peaks impregnable.","4":"The kings got together, they united and came.","5":"They took one look and shook their heads, they scattered and ran away.","6":"They doubled up in pain like a woman having a baby.","7":"You smashed the ships of Tarshish with a storm out of the East.","8":"We heard about it, then we saw it with our eyes--In GOD's city of angel armies, in the city our God Set on firm foundations, firm forever.","9":"We pondered your love--in-action, God, waiting in your temple:","10":"Your name, God, evokes a train of Hallelujahs wherever It is spoken, near and far; your arms are heaped with goodness-in-action.","11":"Be glad, Zion Mountain; Dance, Judah's daughters! He does what he said he'd do!","12":"Circle Zion, take her measure, count her fortress peaks,","13":"Gaze long at her sloping bulwark, climb her citadel heights--Then you can tell the next generation detail by detail the story of God,","14":"Our God forever, who guides us till the end of time. A psalm of the sons of Korah"}
