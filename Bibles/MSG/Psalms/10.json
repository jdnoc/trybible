{"1":"GOD, are you avoiding me? Where are you when I need you?","2":"Full of hot air, the wicked are hot on the trail of the poor. Trip them up, tangle them up in their fine-tuned plots.","3":"The wicked are windbags, the swindlers have foul breath.","4":"The wicked snub GOD, their noses stuck high in the air. Their graffiti are scrawled on the walls: \"Catch us if you can!God is dead.\"","5":"They care nothing for what you think; if you get in their way, they blow you off.","6":"They live (they think) a charmed life: \"We can't go wrong. This is our lucky year!\"","7":"They carry a mouthful of hexes, their tongues spit venom like adders.","8":"They hide behind ordinary people, then pounce on their victims.","9":"They mark the luckless, then wait like a hunter in a blind; When the poor wretch wanders too close, they stab him in the back.","10":"The hapless fool is kicked to the ground, the unlucky victim is brutally axed.","11":"He thinks God has dumped him, he's sure that God is indifferent to his plight.","12":"Time to get up, GOD-get moving. The luckless think they're Godforsaken.","13":"They wonder why the wicked scorn God and get away with it, Why the wicked are so cocksure they'll never come up for audit.","14":"But you know all about it--the contempt, the abuse. I dare to believe that the luckless will get lucky someday in you. You won't let them down: orphans won't be orphans forever.","15":"Break the wicked right arms, break all the evil left arms. Search and destroy every sign of crime.","16":"GOD's grace and order wins; godlessness loses.","17":"The victim's faint pulse picks up; the hearts of the hopeless pump red blood as you put your ear to their lips.","18":"Orphans get parents, the homeless get homes. The reign of terror is over, the rule of the gang lords is ended."}
