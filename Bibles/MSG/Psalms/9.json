{"1":"I'm thanking you, GOD, from a full heart, I'm writing the book on your wonders.","2":"I'm whistling, laughing, and jumping for joy; I'm singing your song, High God.","3":"The day my enemies turned tail and ran, they stumbled on you and fell on their faces.","4":"You took over and set everything right; when I needed you, you were there, taking charge.","5":"You blow the whistle on godless nations; you throw dirty players out of the game, wipe their names right off the roster.","6":"Enemies disappear from the sidelines, their reputation trashed, their names erased from the halls of fame.","7":"GOD holds the high center, he sees and sets the world's mess right.","8":"He decides what is right for us earthlings, gives people their just deserts.","9":"GOD's a safe-house for the battered, a sanctuary during bad times.","10":"The moment you arrive, you relax; you're never sorry you knocked.","11":"Sing your songs to Zion--dwelling GOD, tell his stories to everyone you meet:","12":"How he tracks down killers yet keeps his eye on us, registers every whimper and moan.","13":"Be kind to me, GOD; I've been kicked around long enough. Once you've pulled me back from the gates of death,","14":"I'll write the book on Hallelujahs; on the corner of Main and First I'll hold a street meeting; I'll be the song leader; we'll fill the air with salvation songs.","15":"They're trapped, those godless countries, in the very snares they set, Their feet all tangled in the net they spread.","16":"They have no excuse; the way God works is well-known. The cunning machinery made by the wicked has maimed their own hands.","17":"The wicked bought a one--way ticket to hell.","18":"No longer will the poor be nameless--no more humiliation for the humble.","19":"Up, GOD! Aren't you fed up with their empty strutting? Expose these grand pretensions!","20":"Shake them up, GOD! Show them how silly they look."}
