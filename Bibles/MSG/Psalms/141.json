{"1":"GOD, come close. Come quickly! Open your ears--it's my voice you're hearing!","2":"Treat my prayer as sweet incense rising; my raised hands are my evening prayers.","3":"Post a guard at my mouth, GOD, set a watch at the door of my lips.","4":"Don't let me so much as dream of evil or thoughtlessly fall into bad company. And these people who only do wrong--don't let them lure me with their sweet talk!","5":"May the Just One set me straight, may the Kind One correct me, Don't let sin anoint my head. I'm praying hard against their evil ways!","6":"Oh, let their leaders be pushed off a high rock cliff; make them face the music.","7":"Like a rock pulverized by a maul, let their bones be scattered at the gates of hell.","8":"But GOD, dear Lord, I only have eyes for you. Since I've run for dear life to you, take good care of me.","9":"Protect me from their evil scheming, from all their demonic subterfuge.","10":"Let the wicked fall flat on their faces, while I walk off without a scratch. A David prayer--when he was in the cave. he"}
