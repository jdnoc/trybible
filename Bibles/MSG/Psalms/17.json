{"1":"Listen while I build my case, GOD, the most honest prayer you'll ever hear.","2":"Show the world I'm innocent--in your heart you know I am.","3":"Go ahead, examine me from inside out, surprise me in the middle of the night--You'll find I'm just what I say I am. My words don't run loose.","4":"I'm not trying to get my way in the world's way. I'm trying to get your way, your Word's way.","5":"I'm staying on your trail; I'm putting one foot In front of the other. I'm not giving up.","6":"I call to you, God, because I'm sure of an answer. So--answer! bend your ear! listen sharp!","7":"Paint grace--graffiti on the fences; take in your frightened children who Are running from the neighborhood bullies straight to you.","8":"Keep your eye on me; hide me under your cool wing feathers","9":"From the wicked who are out to get me, from mortal enemies closing in.","10":"Their hearts are hard as nails, their mouths blast hot air.","11":"They are after me, nipping my heels, determined to bring me down,","12":"Lions ready to rip me apart, young lions poised to pounce.","13":"Up, GOD: beard them! break them! By your sword, free me from their clutches;","14":"Barehanded, GOD, break these mortals, these flat--earth people who can't think beyond today. I'd like to see their bellies swollen with famine food, The weeds they've sown harvested and baked into famine bread, With second helpings for their children and crusts for their babies to chew on.","15":"And me? I plan on looking you full in the face. When I get up, I'll see your full stature and live heaven on earth. A David song, which he sang to God after being saved from all his enemies and from Saul."}
