{"1":"Listen, Shepherd, Israel's Shepherd--get all your Joseph sheep together. Throw beams of light from your dazzling throne","2":"So Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh can see where they're going. Get out of bed--you've slept long enough! Come on the run before it's too late.","3":"God, come back! Smile your blessing smile: That will be our salvation.","4":"GOD, God of the angel armies, how long will you smolder like a sleeping volcano while your people call for fire and brimstone?","5":"You put us on a diet of tears, bucket after bucket of salty tears to drink.","6":"You make us look ridiculous to our friends; our enemies poke fun day after day.","7":"God of the angel armies, come back! Smile your blessing smile: That will be our salvation.","8":"Remember how you brought a young vine from Egypt, cleared out the brambles and briers and planted your very own vineyard?","9":"You prepared the good earth, you planted her roots deep; the vineyard filled the land.","10":"Your vine soared high and shaded the mountains, even dwarfing the giant cedars.","11":"Your vine ranged west to the Sea, east to the River.","12":"So why do you no longer protect your vine? Trespassers pick its grapes at will;","13":"Wild pigs crash through and crush it, and the mice nibble away at what's left.","14":"God of the angel armies, turn our way! Take a good look at what's happened and attend to this vine.","15":"Care for what you once tenderly planted--the vine you raised from a shoot.","16":"And those who dared to set it on fire--give them a look that will kill!","17":"Then take the hand of your once-favorite child, the child you raised to adulthood.","18":"We will never turn our back on you; breathe life into our lungs so we can shout your name!","19":"GOD, God of the angel armies, come back! Smile your blessing smile: That will be our salvation. An Asaph psalm"}
