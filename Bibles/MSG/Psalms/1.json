{"1":"How well God must like you--you don't hang out at Sin Saloon, you don't slink along Dead-End Road, you don't go to Smart-Mouth College.","2":"Instead you thrill to GOD's Word, you chew on Scripture day and night.","3":"You're a tree replanted in Eden, bearing fresh fruit every month, Never dropping a leaf, always in blossom.","4":"You're not at all like the wicked, who are mere windblown dust--","5":"Without defense in court, unfit company for innocent people.","6":"GOD charts the road you take. The road they take is Skid Row."}
