{"1":"Bilious and bloated, they gas, \"God is gone.\" Their words are poison gas, fouling the air; they poison Rivers and skies; thistles are their cash crop.","2":"GOD sticks his head out of heaven. He looks around. He's looking for someone not stupid--one man, even, God--expectant, just one God--ready woman.","3":"He comes up empty. A string of zeros. Useless, unshepherded Sheep, taking turns pretending to be Shepherd. The ninety and nine follow their fellow.","4":"Don't they know anything, all these impostors? Don't they know they can't get away with this--Treating people like a fast-food meal over which they're too busy to pray?","5":"Night is coming for them, and nightmares, for God takes the side of victims.","6":"Do you think you can mess with the dreams of the poor? You can't, for God makes their dreams come true.","7":"Is there anyone around to save Israel? Yes. God is around; GOD turns life around. Turned-around Jacob skips rope, turned-around Israel sings laughter."}
