{"1":"Thank you! Everything in me says \"Thank you!\" Angels listen as I sing my thanks.","2":"I kneel in worship facing your holy temple and say it again: \"Thank you!\" Thank you for your love, thank you for your faithfulness; Most holy is your name, most holy is your Word.","3":"The moment I called out, you stepped in; you made my life large with strength.","4":"When they hear what you have to say, GOD, all earth's kings will say \"Thank you.\"","5":"They'll sing of what you've done: \"How great the glory of GOD!\"","6":"And here's why: GOD, high above, sees far below; no matter the distance, he knows everything about us.","7":"When I walk into the thick of trouble, keep me alive in the angry turmoil. With one hand strike my foes, With your other hand save me.","8":"Finish what you started in me, GOD. Your love is eternal--don't quit on me now."}
