{"1":"Long enough, GOD- you've ignored me long enough. I've looked at the back of your head long enough.","2":"Long enough I've carried this ton of trouble, lived with a stomach full of pain. Long enough my arrogant enemies have looked down their noses at me.","3":"Take a good look at me, GOD, my God; I want to look life in the eye,","4":"So no enemy can get the best of me or laugh when I fall on my face.","5":"I've thrown myself headlong into your arms--I'm celebrating your rescue.","6":"I'm singing at the top of my lungs, I'm so full of answered prayers."}
