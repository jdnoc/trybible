{"1":"God! Please hurry to my rescue! God, come quickly to my side!","2":"Those who are out to get me--let them fall all over themselves. Those who relish my downfall--send them down a blind alley.","3":"Give them a taste of their own medicine, those gossips off clucking their tongues.","4":"Let those on the hunt for you sing and celebrate. Let all who love your saving way say over and over, \"God is mighty!\"","5":"But I've lost it. I'm wasted. God--quickly, quickly! Quick to my side, quick to my rescue! GOD, don't lose a minute."}
