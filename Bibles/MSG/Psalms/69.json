{"1":"God, God, save me! I'm in over my head,","2":"Quicksand under me, swamp water over me; I'm going down for the third time.","3":"I'm hoarse from calling for help, Bleary-eyed from searching the sky for God.","4":"I've got more enemies than hairs on my head; Sneaks and liars are out to knife me in the back. What I never stole Must I now give back?","5":"God, you know every sin I've committed; My life's a wide-open book before you.","6":"Don't let those who look to you in hope Be discouraged by what happens to me, Dear Lord! GOD of the armies! Don't let those out looking for you Come to a dead end by following me--Please, dear God of Israel!","7":"Because of you I look like an idiot, I walk around ashamed to show my face.","8":"My brothers shun me like a bum off the street; My family treats me like an unwanted guest.","9":"I love you more than I can say. Because I'm madly in love with you, They blame me for everything they dislike about you.","10":"When I poured myself out in prayer and fasting, All it got me was more contempt.","11":"When I put on a sad face, They treated me like a clown.","12":"Now drunks and gluttons Make up drinking songs about me.","13":"And me? I pray. GOD, it's time for a break! God, answer in love! Answer with your sure salvation!","14":"Rescue me from the swamp, Don't let me go under for good, Pull me out of the clutch of the enemy; This whirlpool is sucking me down.","15":"Don't let the swamp be my grave, the Black Hole Swallow me, its jaws clenched around me.","16":"Now answer me, GOD, because you love me; Let me see your great mercy full-face.","17":"Don't look the other way; your servant can't take it. I'm in trouble. Answer right now!","18":"Come close, God; get me out of here. Rescue me from this deathtrap.","19":"You know how they kick me around--Pin on me the donkey's ears, the dunce's cap.","20":"I'm broken by their taunts, Flat on my face, reduced to a nothing. I looked in vain for one friendly face. Not one. I couldn't find one shoulder to cry on.","21":"They put poison in my soup, Vinegar in my drink.","22":"Let their supper be bait in a trap that snaps shut; May their best friends be trappers who'll skin them alive.","23":"Make them become blind as bats, Give them the shakes from morning to night.","24":"Let them know what you think of them, Blast them with your red-hot anger.","25":"Burn down their houses, Leave them desolate with nobody at home.","26":"They gossiped about the one you disciplined, Made up stories about anyone wounded by God.","27":"Pile on the guilt, Don't let them off the hook.","28":"Strike their names from the list of the living; No rock-carved honor for them among the righteous.","29":"I'm hurt and in pain; Give me space for healing, and mountain air.","30":"Let me shout God's name with a praising song, Let me tell his greatness in a prayer of thanks.","31":"For GOD, this is better than oxen on the altar, Far better than blue-ribbon bulls.","32":"The poor in spirit see and are glad--Oh, you God--seekers, take heart!","33":"For GOD listens to the poor, He doesn't walk out on the wretched.","34":"You heavens, praise him; praise him, earth; Also ocean and all things that swim in it.","35":"For God is out to help Zion, Rebuilding the wrecked towns of Judah. Guess who will live there--The proud owners of the land?","36":"No, the children of his servants will get it, The lovers of his name will live in it. A David prayer"}
