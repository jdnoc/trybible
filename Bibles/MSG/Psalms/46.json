{"1":"God is a safe place to hide, ready to help when we need him.","2":"We stand fearless at the cliff-edge of doom, courageous in seastorm and earthquake,","3":"Before the rush and roar of oceans, the tremors that shift mountains. Jacob-wrestling God fights for us, GOD of angel armies protects us.","4":"River fountains splash joy, cooling God's city, this sacred haunt of the Most High.","5":"God lives here, the streets are safe, God at your service from crack of dawn.","6":"Godless nations rant and rave, kings and kingdoms threaten, but Earth does anything he says.","7":"Jacob-wrestling God fights for us, GOD of angel armies protects us.","8":"Attention, all! See the marvels of GOD! He plants flowers and trees all over the earth,","9":"Bans war from pole to pole, breaks all the weapons across his knee.","10":"\"Step out of the traffic! Take a long, loving look at me, your High God, above politics, above everything.\"","11":"Jacob-wrestling God fights for us, GOD of angel armies protects us. A psalm of the sons of Korah"}
