{"1":"Your strength, GOD, is the king's strength. Helped, he's hollering Hosannas.","2":"You gave him exactly what he wanted; you didn't hold back.","3":"You filled his arms with gifts; you gave him a right royal welcome.","4":"He wanted a good life; you gave it to him, and then made it a long life as a bonus.","5":"You lifted him high and bright as a cumulus cloud, then dressed him in rainbow colors.","6":"You pile blessings on him; you make him glad when you smile.","7":"Is it any wonder the king loves GOD? that he's sticking with the Best?","8":"With a fistful of enemies in one hand and a fistful of haters in the other,","9":"You radiate with such brilliance that they cringe as before a furnace. Now the furnace swallows them whole, the fire eats them alive!","10":"You purge the earth of their progeny, you wipe the slate clean.","11":"All their evil schemes, the plots they cook up, have fizzled--every one.","12":"You sent them packing; they couldn't face you.","13":"Show your strength, GOD, so no one can miss it. We are out singing the good news!"}
