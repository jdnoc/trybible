{"1":"Help, GOD-the bottom has fallen out of my life! Master, hear my cry for help!","2":"Listen hard! Open your ears! Listen to my cries for mercy.","3":"If you, GOD, kept records on wrongdoings, who would stand a chance?","4":"As it turns out, forgiveness is your habit, and that's why you're worshiped.","5":"I pray to GOD-my life a prayer--and wait for what he'll say and do.","6":"My life's on the line before God, my Lord, waiting and watching till morning, waiting and watching till morning.","7":"O Israel, wait and watch for GOD- with GOD's arrival comes love, with GOD's arrival comes generous redemption.","8":"No doubt about it--he'll redeem Israel, buy back Israel from captivity to sin."}
