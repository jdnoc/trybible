{"1":"My theme song is God's love and justice, and I'm singing it right to you, GOD.","2":"I'm finding my way down the road of right living, but how long before you show up? I'm doing the very best I can, and I'm doing it at home, where it counts.","3":"I refuse to take a second look at corrupting people and degrading things. I reject made-in-Canaan gods, stay clear of contamination.","4":"The crooked in heart keep their distance; I refuse to shake hands with those who plan evil.","5":"I put a gag on the gossip who bad-mouths his neighbor; I can't stand arrogance.","6":"But I have my eye on salt-of-the-earth people--they're the ones I want working with me; Men and women on the straight and narrow--these are the ones I want at my side.","7":"But no one who traffics in lies gets a job with me; I have no patience with liars. I've rounded up all the wicked like cattle and herded them right out of the country.","8":"I purged GOD's city of all who make a business of evil. A prayer of one whose life is falling to pieces, and who lets God know just how bad it is."}
