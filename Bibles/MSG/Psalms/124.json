{"1":"If GOD hadn't been for us -all together now, Israel, sing out!-","2":"If GOD hadn't been for us when everyone went against us,","3":"We would have been swallowed alive by their violent anger,","4":"Swept away by the flood of rage, drowned in the torrent;","5":"We would have lost our lives in the wild, raging water.","6":"Oh, blessed be GOD! He didn't go off and leave us. He didn't abandon us defenseless, helpless as a rabbit in a pack of snarling dogs.","7":"We've flown free from their fangs, free of their traps, free as a bird. Their grip is broken; we're free as a bird in flight.","8":"GOD's strong name is our help, the same GOD who made heaven and earth."}
