{"1":"GOD rules. On your toes, everybody! He rules from his angel throne--take notice!","2":"GOD looms majestic in Zion, He towers in splendor over all the big names.","3":"Great and terrible your beauty: let everyone praise you! Holy. Yes, holy.","4":"Strong King, lover of justice, You laid things out fair and square; You set down the foundations in Jacob, Foundation stones of just and right ways.","5":"Honor GOD, our God; worship his rule! Holy. Yes, holy.","6":"Moses and Aaron were his priests, Samuel among those who prayed to him. They prayed to GOD and he answered them;","7":"He spoke from the pillar of cloud. And they did what he said; they kept the law he gave them.","8":"And then GOD, our God, answered them (But you were never soft on their sins).","9":"Lift high GOD, our God; worship at his holy mountain. Holy. Yes, holy is GOD our God. A thanksgiving psalm"}
