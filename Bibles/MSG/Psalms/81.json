{"1":"A song to our strong God! a shout to the God of Jacob!","2":"Anthems from the choir, music from the band, sweet sounds from lute and harp,","3":"Trumpets and trombones and horns: it's festival day, a feast to God!","4":"A day decreed by God, solemnly ordered by the God of Jacob.","5":"He commanded Joseph to keep this day so we'd never forget what he did in Egypt. I hear this most gentle whisper from One I never guessed would speak to me:","6":"\"I took the world off your shoulders, freed you from a life of hard labor.","7":"You called to me in your pain; I got you out of a bad place. I answered you from where the thunder hides, I proved you at Meribah Fountain.","8":"\"Listen, dear ones--get this straight; O Israel, don't take this lightly.","9":"Don't take up with strange gods, don't worship the latest in gods.","10":"I'm GOD, your God, the very God who rescued you from doom in Egypt, Then fed you all you could eat, filled your hungry stomachs.","11":"\"But my people didn't listen, Israel paid no attention;","12":"So I let go of the reins and told them, \"Run! Do it your own way!'","13":"\"Oh, dear people, will you listen to me now? Israel, will you follow my map?","14":"I'll make short work of your enemies, give your foes the back of my hand.","15":"I'll send the GOD-haters cringing like dogs, never to be heard from again.","16":"You'll feast on my fresh-baked bread spread with butter and rock-pure honey.\" An Asaph psalm"}
