{"1":"GOD is King, robed and ruling, GOD is robed and surging with strength. And yes, the world is firm, immovable,","2":"Your throne ever firm--you're Eternal!","3":"Sea storms are up, GOD, Sea storms wild and roaring, Sea storms with thunderous breakers.","4":"Stronger than wild sea storms, Mightier than sea-storm breakers, Mighty GOD rules from High Heaven.","5":"What you say goes--it always has. \"Beauty\" and \"Holy\" mark your palace rule, GOD, to the very end of time."}
