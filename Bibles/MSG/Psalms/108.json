{"1":"I'm ready, God, so ready, ready from head to toe. Ready to sing, ready to raise a God--song:","2":"\"Wake, soul! Wake, lute! Wake up, you sleepyhead sun!\"","3":"I'm thanking you, GOD, out in the streets, singing your praises in town and country.","4":"The deeper your love, the higher it goes; every cloud's a flag to your faithfulness.","5":"Soar high in the skies, O God! Cover the whole earth with your glory!","6":"And for the sake of the one you love so much, reach down and help me--answer me!","7":"That's when God spoke in holy splendor: \"Brimming over with joy, I make a present of Shechem, I hand out Succoth Valley as a gift.","8":"Gilead's in my pocket, to say nothing of Manasseh. Ephraim's my hard hat, Judah my hammer.","9":"Moab's a scrub bucket--I mop the floor with Moab, Spit on Edom, rain fireworks all over Philistia.\"","10":"Who will take me to the thick of the fight? Who'll show me the road to Edom?","11":"You aren't giving up on us, are you, God? refusing to go out with our troops?","12":"Give us help for the hard task; human help is worthless.","13":"In God we'll do our very best; he'll flatten the opposition for good. A David prayer"}
