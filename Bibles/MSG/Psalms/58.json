{"1":"Is this any way to run a country? Is there an honest politician in the house?","2":"Behind the scenes you brew cauldrons of evil, behind closed doors you make deals with demons.","3":"The wicked crawl from the wrong side of the cradle; their first words out of the womb are lies.","4":"Poison, lethal rattlesnake poison, drips from their forked tongues--","5":"Deaf to threats, deaf to charm, decades of wax built up in their ears.","6":"God, smash their teeth to bits, leave them toothless tigers.","7":"Let their lives be buckets of water spilled, all that's left, a damp stain in the sand. Let them be trampled grass worn smooth by the traffic.","8":"Let them dissolve into snail slime, be a miscarried fetus that never sees sunlight.","9":"Before what they cook up is half-done, God, throw it out with the garbage!","10":"The righteous will call up their friends when they see the wicked get their reward, Serve up their blood in goblets as they toast one another,","11":"Everyone cheering, \"It's worth it to play by the rules! God's handing out trophies and tending the earth!\""}
