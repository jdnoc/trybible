{"1":"The God--rebel tunes in to sedition--all ears, eager to sin. He has no regard for God, he stands insolent before him.","2":"He has smooth-talked himself into believing That his evil will never be noticed.","3":"Words gutter from his mouth, dishwater dirty. Can't remember when he did anything decent.","4":"Every time he goes to bed, he fathers another evil plot. When he's loose on the streets, nobody's safe. He plays with fire and doesn't care who gets burned.","5":"God's love is meteoric, his loyalty astronomic,","6":"His purpose titanic, his verdicts oceanic. Yet in his largeness nothing gets lost; Not a man, not a mouse, slips through the cracks.","7":"How exquisite your love, O God! How eager we are to run under your wings,","8":"To eat our fill at the banquet you spread as you fill our tankards with Eden spring water.","9":"You're a fountain of cascading light, and you open our eyes to light.","10":"Keep on loving your friends; do your work in welcoming hearts.","11":"Don't let the bullies kick me around, the moral midgets slap me down.","12":"Send the upstarts sprawling flat on their faces in the mud."}
