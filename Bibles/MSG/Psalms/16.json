{"1":"Keep me safe, O God, I've run for dear life to you.","2":"I say to GOD, \"Be my Lord!\" Without you, nothing makes sense.","3":"And these God--chosen lives all around--what splendid friends they make!","4":"Don't just go shopping for a god. Gods are not for sale. I swear I'll never treat god-names like brand-names.","5":"My choice is you, GOD, first and only. And now I find I'm your choice!","6":"You set me up with a house and yard. And then you made me your heir!","7":"The wise counsel GOD gives when I'm awake is confirmed by my sleeping heart.","8":"Day and night I'll stick with GOD; I've got a good thing going and I'm not letting go.","9":"I'm happy from the inside out, and from the outside in, I'm firmly formed.","10":"You canceled my ticket to hell--that's not my destination!","11":"Now you've got my feet on the life path, all radiant from the shining of your face. Ever since you took my hand, I'm on the right way. A David prayer"}
