{"1":"Hallelujah! Praise God in his holy house of worship, praise him under the open skies;","2":"Praise him for his acts of power, praise him for his magnificent greatness;","3":"Praise with a blast on the trumpet, praise by strumming soft strings;","4":"Praise him with castanets and dance, praise him with banjo and flute;","5":"Praise him with cymbals and a big bass drum, praise him with fiddles and mandolin.","6":"Let every living, breathing creature praise GOD! Hallelujah!"}
