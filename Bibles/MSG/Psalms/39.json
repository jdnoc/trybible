But the longer I kept silence The worse it got--","3":"my insides got hotter and hotter. My thoughts boiled over; I spilled my guts.","4":"\"Tell me, what's going on, GOD? How long do I have to live? Give me the bad news!","5":"You've kept me on pretty short rations; my life is string too short to be saved.","6":"Oh! we're all puffs of air. Oh! we're all shadows in a campfire. Oh! we're just spit in the wind. We make our pile, and then we leave it.","7":"\"What am I doing in the meantime, Lord?
