{"1":"Why the big noise, nations? Why the mean plots, peoples?","2":"Earth-leaders push for position, Demagogues and delegates meet for summit talks, The God--deniers, the Messiah-defiers:","3":"\"Let's get free of God! Cast loose from Messiah!\"","4":"Heaven-throned God breaks out laughing. At first he's amused at their presumption;","5":"Then he gets good and angry. Furiously, he shuts them up:","6":"\"Don't you know there's a King in Zion? A coronation banquet Is spread for him on the holy summit.\"","7":"Let me tell you what GOD said next. He said, \"You're my son, And today is your birthday.","8":"What do you want? Name it: Nations as a present? continents as a prize?","9":"You can command them all to dance for you, Or throw them out with tomorrow's trash.\"","10":"So, rebel-kings, use your heads; Upstart-judges, learn your lesson:","11":"Worship GOD in adoring embrace, Celebrate in trembling awe.","12":"Kiss Messiah! Your very lives are in danger, you know; His anger is about to explode, But if you make a run for God--you won't regret it!"}
