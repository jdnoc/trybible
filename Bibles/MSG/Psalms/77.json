{"1":"I yell out to my God, I yell with all my might, I yell at the top of my lungs. He listens.","2":"I found myself in trouble and went looking for my Lord; my life was an open wound that wouldn't heal. When friends said, \"Everything will turn out all right,\" I didn't believe a word they said.","3":"I remember God--and shake my head. I bow my head--then wring my hands.","4":"I'm awake all night--not a wink of sleep; I can't even say what's bothering me.","5":"I go over the days one by one, I ponder the years gone by.","6":"I strum my lute all through the night, wondering how to get my life together.","7":"Will the Lord walk off and leave us for good? Will he never smile again?","8":"Is his love worn threadbare? Has his salvation promise burned out?","9":"Has God forgotten his manners? Has he angrily stalked off and left us?","10":"\"Just my luck,\" I said. \"The High God goes out of business just the moment I need him.\"","11":"Once again I'll go over what GOD has done, lay out on the table the ancient wonders;","12":"I'll ponder all the things you've accomplished, and give a long, loving look at your acts.","13":"O God! Your way is holy! No god is great like God!","14":"You're the God who makes things happen; you showed everyone what you can do--","15":"You pulled your people out of the worst kind of trouble, rescued the children of Jacob and Joseph.","16":"Ocean saw you in action, God, saw you and trembled with fear; Deep Ocean was scared to death.","17":"Clouds belched buckets of rain, Sky exploded with thunder, your arrows flashing this way and that.","18":"From Whirlwind came your thundering voice, Lightning exposed the world, Earth reeled and rocked.","19":"You strode right through Ocean, walked straight through roaring Ocean, but nobody saw you come or go.","20":"Hidden in the hands of Moses and Aaron, You led your people like a flock of sheep. An Asaph psalm"}
