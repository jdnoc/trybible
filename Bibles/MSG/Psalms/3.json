No help for him from God!\"","3":"But you, GOD, shield me on all sides; You ground my feet, you lift my head high;","4":"With all my might I shout up to GOD, His answers thunder from the holy mountain.","5":"I stretch myself out. I sleep. Then I'm up again--rested, tall and steady,","6":"Fearless before the enemy mobs Coming at me from all sides.","7":"Up, GOD! My God, help me!
