{"1":"If GOD doesn't build the house, the builders only build shacks. If GOD doesn't guard the city, the night watchman might as well nap.","2":"It's useless to rise early and go to bed late, and work your worried fingers to the bone. Don't you know he enjoys giving rest to those he loves?","3":"Don't you see that children are GOD's best gift? the fruit of the womb his generous legacy?","4":"Like a warrior's fistful of arrows are the children of a vigorous youth.","5":"Oh, how blessed are you parents, with your quivers full of children! Your enemies don't stand a chance against you; you'll sweep them right off your doorstep."}
