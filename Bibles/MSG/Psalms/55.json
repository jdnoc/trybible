{"1":"Open your ears, God, to my prayer; don't pretend you don't hear me knocking.","2":"Come close and whisper your answer. I really need you. I shudder","3":"at the mean voice, quail before the evil eye, As they pile on the guilt, stockpile angry slander.","4":"My insides are turned inside out; specters of death have me down.","5":"I shake with fear, I shudder from head to foot.","6":"\"Who will give me wings,\" I ask--\"wings like a dove?\" Get me out of here on dove wings;","7":"I want some peace and quiet. I want a walk in the country,","8":"I want a cabin in the woods. I'm desperate for a change from rage and stormy weather.","9":"Come down hard, Lord--slit their tongues. I'm appalled how they've split the city Into rival gangs prowling the alleys","10":"Day and night spoiling for a fight, trash piled in the streets,","11":"Even shopkeepers gouging and cheating in broad daylight.","12":"This isn't the neighborhood bully mocking me--I could take that. This isn't a foreign devil spitting invective--I could tune that out.","13":"It's you! We grew up together! You! My best friend!","14":"Those long hours of leisure as we walked arm in arm, God a third party to our conversation.","15":"Haul my betrayers off alive to hell--let them experience the horror, let them feel every desolate detail of a damned life.","16":"I call to God; GOD will help me.","17":"At dusk, dawn, and noon I sigh deep sighs--he hears, he rescues.","18":"My life is well and whole, secure in the middle of danger Even while thousands are lined up against me.","19":"God hears it all, and from his judge's bench puts them in their place. But, set in their ways, they won't change; they pay him no mind.","20":"And this, my best friend, betrayed his best friends; his life betrayed his word.","21":"All my life I've been charmed by his speech, never dreaming he'd turn on me. His words, which were music to my ears, turned to daggers in my heart.","22":"Pile your troubles on GOD's shoulders--he'll carry your load, he'll help you out. He'll never let good people topple into ruin.","23":"But you, God, will throw the others into a muddy bog, Cut the lifespan of assassins and traitors in half. And I trust in you."}
