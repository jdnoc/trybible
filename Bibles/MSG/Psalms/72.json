{"1":"Give the gift of wise rule to the king, O God, the gift of just rule to the crown prince.","2":"May he judge your people rightly, be honorable to your meek and lowly.","3":"Let the mountains give exuberant witness; shape the hills with the contours of right living.","4":"Please stand up for the poor, help the children of the needy, come down hard on the cruel tyrants.","5":"Outlast the sun, outlive the moon--age after age after age.","6":"Be rainfall on cut grass, earth-refreshing rain showers.","7":"Let righteousness burst into blossom and peace abound until the moon fades to nothing.","8":"Rule from sea to sea, from the River to the Rim.","9":"Foes will fall on their knees before God, his enemies lick the dust.","10":"Kings remote and legendary will pay homage, kings rich and resplendent will turn over their wealth.","11":"All kings will fall down and worship, and godless nations sign up to serve him,","12":"Because he rescues the poor at the first sign of need, the destitute who have run out of luck.","13":"He opens a place in his heart for the down--and-out, he restores the wretched of the earth.","14":"He frees them from tyranny and torture--when they bleed, he bleeds; when they die, he dies.","15":"And live! Oh, let him live! Deck him out in Sheba gold. Offer prayers unceasing to him, bless him from morning to night.","16":"Fields of golden grain in the land, cresting the mountains in wild exuberance, Cornucopias of praise, praises springing from the city like grass from the earth.","17":"May he never be forgotten, his fame shine on like sunshine. May all godless people enter his circle of blessing and bless the One who blessed them.","18":"Blessed GOD, Israel's God, the one and only wonder-working God!","19":"Blessed always his blazing glory! All earth brims with his glory.","20":"Yes and Yes and Yes. An Asaph psalm"}
