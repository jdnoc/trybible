{"1":"Hallelujah! O my soul, praise GOD!","2":"All my life long I'll praise GOD, singing songs to my God as long as I live.","3":"Don't put your life in the hands of experts who know nothing of life, of salvation life.","4":"Mere humans don't have what it takes; when they die, their projects die with them.","5":"Instead, get help from the God of Jacob, put your hope in GOD and know real blessing!","6":"GOD made sky and soil, sea and all the fish in it. He always does what he says--","7":"he defends the wronged, he feeds the hungry. GOD frees prisoners--","8":"he gives sight to the blind, he lifts up the fallen. GOD loves good people,","9":"protects strangers, takes the side of orphans and widows, but makes short work of the wicked.","10":"GOD's in charge--always. Zion's God is God for good! Hallelujah! al"}
