{"1":"GOD, brilliant Lord, yours is a household name.","2":"Nursing infants gurgle choruses about you; toddlers shout the songs That drown out enemy talk, and silence atheist babble.","3":"I look up at your macro-skies, dark and enormous, your handmade sky-jewelry, Moon and stars mounted in their settings.","4":"Then I look at my micro-self and wonder, Why do you bother with us? Why take a second look our way?","5":"Yet we've so narrowly missed being gods, bright with Eden's dawn light.","6":"You put us in charge of your handcrafted world, repeated to us your Genesis-charge,","7":"Made us lords of sheep and cattle, even animals out in the wild,","8":"Birds flying and fish swimming, whales singing in the ocean deeps.","9":"GOD, brilliant Lord, your name echoes around the world."}
