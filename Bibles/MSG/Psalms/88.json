{"1":"GOD, you're my last chance of the day. I spend the night on my knees before you.","2":"Put me on your salvation agenda; take notes on the trouble I'm in.","3":"I've had my fill of trouble; I'm camped on the edge of hell.","4":"I'm written off as a lost cause, one more statistic, a hopeless case.","5":"Abandoned as already dead, one more body in a stack of corpses, And not so much as a gravestone--I'm a black hole in oblivion.","6":"You've dropped me into a bottomless pit, sunk me in a pitch-black abyss.","7":"I'm battered senseless by your rage, relentlessly pounded by your waves of anger.","8":"You turned my friends against me, made me horrible to them. I'm caught in a maze and can't find my way out,","9":"blinded by tears of pain and frustration. I call to you, GOD; all day I call. I wring my hands, I plead for help.","10":"Are the dead a live audience for your miracles? Do ghosts ever join the choirs that praise you?","11":"Does your love make any difference in a graveyard? Is your faithful presence noticed in the corridors of hell?","12":"Are your marvelous wonders ever seen in the dark, your righteous ways noticed in the Land of No Memory?","13":"I'm standing my ground, GOD, shouting for help, at my prayers every morning, on my knees each daybreak.","14":"Why, GOD, do you turn a deaf ear? Why do you make yourself scarce?","15":"For as long as I remember I've been hurting; I've taken the worst you can hand out, and I've had it.","16":"Your wildfire anger has blazed through my life; I'm bleeding, black and blue.","17":"You've attacked me fiercely from every side, raining down blows till I'm nearly dead.","18":"You made lover and neighbor alike dump me; the only friend I have left is Darkness. An Ethan prayer"}
