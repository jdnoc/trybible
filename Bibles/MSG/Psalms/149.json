{"1":"Hallelujah! Sing to GOD a brand-new song, praise him in the company of all who love him.","2":"Let all Israel celebrate their Sovereign Creator, Zion's children exult in their King.","3":"Let them praise his name in dance; strike up the band and make great music!","4":"And why? Because GOD delights in his people, festoons plain folk with salvation garlands!","5":"Let true lovers break out in praise, sing out from wherever they're sitting,","6":"Shout the high praises of God, brandish their swords in the wild sword--dance--","7":"A portent of vengeance on the God--defying nations, a signal that punishment's coming,","8":"Their kings chained and hauled off to jail, their leaders behind bars for good,","9":"The judgment on them carried out to the letter -and all who love God in the seat of honor! Hallelujah! al"}
