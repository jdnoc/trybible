{"1":"GOD, get me out of here, away from this evil; protect me from these vicious people.","2":"All they do is think up new ways to be bad; they spend their days plotting war games.","3":"They practice the sharp rhetoric of hate and hurt, speak venomous words that maim and kill.","4":"GOD, keep me out of the clutch of these wicked ones, protect me from these vicious people;","5":"Stuffed with self-importance, they plot ways to trip me up, determined to bring me down. These crooks invent traps to catch me and do their best to incriminate me.","6":"I prayed, \"GOD, you're my God! Listen, GOD! Mercy!","7":"GOD, my Lord, Strong Savior, protect me when the fighting breaks out!","8":"Don't let the wicked have their way, GOD, don't give them an inch!\"","9":"These troublemakers all around me--let them drown in their own verbal poison.","10":"Let God pile hellfire on them, let him bury them alive in crevasses!","11":"These loudmouths--don't let them be taken seriously; These savages--let the Devil hunt them down!","12":"I know that you, GOD, are on the side of victims, that you care for the rights of the poor.","13":"And I know that the righteous personally thank you, that good people are secure in your presence."}
