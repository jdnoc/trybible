{"1":"I look to you, heaven-dwelling God, look up to you for help.","2":"Like servants, alert to their master's commands, like a maiden attending her lady, We're watching and waiting, holding our breath, awaiting your word of mercy.","3":"Mercy, GOD, mercy! We've been kicked around long enough,","4":"Kicked in the teeth by complacent rich men, kicked when we're down by arrogant brutes."}
