{"1":"GOD answer you on the day you crash, The name God--of-Jacob put you out of harm's reach,","2":"Send reinforcements from Holy Hill, Dispatch from Zion fresh supplies,","3":"Exclaim over your offerings, Celebrate your sacrifices,","4":"Give you what your heart desires, Accomplish your plans.","5":"When you win, we plan to raise the roof and lead the parade with our banners. May all your wishes come true!","6":"That clinches it--help's coming, an answer's on the way, everything's going to work out.","7":"See those people polishing their chariots, and those others grooming their horses? But we're making garlands for GOD our God.","8":"The chariots will rust, those horses pull up lame--and we'll be on our feet, standing tall.","9":"Make the king a winner, GOD; the day we call, give us your answer."}
