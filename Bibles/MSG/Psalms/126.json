{"1":"It seemed like a dream, too good to be true, when GOD returned Zion's exiles.","2":"We laughed, we sang, we couldn't believe our good fortune. We were the talk of the nations--\"GOD was wonderful to them!\"","3":"GOD was wonderful to us; we are one happy people.","4":"And now, GOD, do it again--bring rains to our drought-stricken lives","5":"So those who planted their crops in despair will shout hurrahs at the harvest,","6":"So those who went off with heavy hearts will come home laughing, with armloads of blessing."}
