{"1":"When I call, give me answers. God, take my side! Once, in a tight place, you gave me room; Now I'm in trouble again: grace me! hear me!","2":"You rabble--how long do I put up with your scorn? How long will you lust after lies? How long will you live crazed by illusion?","3":"Look at this: look Who got picked by GOD! He listens the split second I call to him.","4":"Complain if you must, but don't lash out. Keep your mouth shut, and let your heart do the talking.","5":"Build your case before God and wait for his verdict.","6":"Why is everyone hungry for more? \"More, more,\" they say. \"More, more.\" I have God's more-than-enough,","7":"More joy in one ordinary day Than they get in all their shopping sprees.","8":"At day's end I'm ready for sound sleep, For you, GOD, have put my life back together."}
