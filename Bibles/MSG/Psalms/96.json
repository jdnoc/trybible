{"1":"Sing GOD a brand-new song! Earth and everyone in it, sing!","2":"Sing to GOD-worship GOD! Shout the news of his victory from sea to sea,","3":"Take the news of his glory to the lost, News of his wonders to one and all!","4":"For GOD is great, and worth a thousand Hallelujahs. His terrible beauty makes the gods look cheap;","5":"Pagan gods are mere tatters and rags. GOD made the heavens--","6":"Royal splendor radiates from him, A powerful beauty sets him apart.","7":"Bravo, GOD, Bravo! Everyone join in the great shout: Encore! In awe before the beauty, in awe before the might.","8":"Bring gifts and celebrate,","9":"Bow before the beauty of GOD, Then to your knees--everyone worship!","10":"Get out the message--GOD Rules! He put the world on a firm foundation; He treats everyone fair and square.","11":"Let's hear it from Sky, With Earth joining in, And a huge round of applause from Sea.","12":"Let Wilderness turn cartwheels, Animals, come dance, Put every tree of the forest in the choir--","13":"An extravaganza before GOD as he comes, As he comes to set everything right on earth, Set everything right, treat everyone fair."}
