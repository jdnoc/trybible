{"1":"Hallelujah! Blessed man, blessed woman, who fear GOD, Who cherish and relish his commandments,","2":"Their children robust on the earth, And the homes of the upright--how blessed!","3":"Their houses brim with wealth And a generosity that never runs dry.","4":"Sunrise breaks through the darkness for good people--God's grace and mercy and justice!","5":"The good person is generous and lends lavishly;","6":"No shuffling or stumbling around for this one, But a sterling and solid and lasting reputation.","7":"Unfazed by rumor and gossip, Heart ready, trusting in GOD,","8":"Spirit firm, unperturbed, Ever blessed, relaxed among enemies,","9":"They lavish gifts on the poor--A generosity that goes on, and on, and on. An honored life! A beautiful life!","10":"Someone wicked takes one look and rages, Blusters away but ends up speechless. There's nothing to the dreams of the wicked. Nothing. he"}
