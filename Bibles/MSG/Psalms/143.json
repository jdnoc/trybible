{"1":"Listen to this prayer of mine, GOD; pay attention to what I'm asking. Answer me--you're famous for your answers! Do what's right for me.","2":"But don't, please don't, haul me into court; not a person alive would be acquitted there.","3":"The enemy hunted me down; he kicked me and stomped me within an inch of my life. He put me in a black hole, buried me like a corpse in that dungeon.","4":"I sat there in despair, my spirit draining away, my heart heavy, like lead.","5":"I remembered the old days, went over all you've done, pondered the ways you've worked,","6":"Stretched out my hands to you, as thirsty for you as a desert thirsty for rain.","7":"Hurry with your answer, GOD! I'm nearly at the end of my rope. Don't turn away; don't ignore me! That would be certain death.","8":"If you wake me each morning with the sound of your loving voice, I'll go to sleep each night trusting in you. Point out the road I must travel; I'm all ears, all eyes before you.","9":"Save me from my enemies, GOD- you're my only hope!","10":"Teach me how to live to please you, because you're my God. Lead me by your blessed Spirit into cleared and level pastureland.","11":"Keep up your reputation, God--give me life! In your justice, get me out of this trouble!","12":"In your great love, vanquish my enemies; make a clean sweep of those who harass me. And why? Because I'm your servant."}
