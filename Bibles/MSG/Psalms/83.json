{"1":"GOD, don't shut me out; don't give me the silent treatment, O God.","2":"Your enemies are out there whooping it up, the God--haters are living it up;","3":"They're plotting to do your people in, conspiring to rob you of your precious ones.","4":"\"Let's wipe this nation from the face of the earth,\" they say; \"scratch Israel's name off the books.\"","5":"And now they're putting their heads together, making plans to get rid of you.","6":"Edom and the Ishmaelites, Moab and the Hagrites,","7":"Gebal and Ammon and Amalek, Philistia and the Tyrians,","8":"And now Assyria has joined up, Giving muscle to the gang of Lot.","9":"Do to them what you did to Midian, to Sisera and Jabin at Kishon Brook;","10":"They came to a bad end at Endor, nothing but dung for the garden.","11":"Cut down their leaders as you did Oreb and Zeeb, their princes to nothings like Zebah and Zalmunna,","12":"With their empty brags, \"We're grabbing it all, grabbing God's gardens for ourselves.\"","13":"My God! I've had it with them! Blow them away! Tumbleweeds in the desert waste,","14":"charred sticks in the burned-over ground.","15":"Knock the breath right out of them, so they're gasping","16":"for breath, gasping, \"GOD.\"","17":"Bring them to the end of their rope, and leave them there dangling, helpless.","18":"Then they'll learn your name: \"GOD,\" the one and only High God on earth. A Korah psalm"}
