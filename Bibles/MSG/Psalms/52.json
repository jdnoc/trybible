God's mercy carries the day.","2":"You scheme catastrophe; your tongue cuts razor-sharp, artisan in lies.","3":"You love evil more than good, you call black white.","4":"You love malicious gossip, you foul-mouth.","5":"God will tear you limb from limb, sweep you up and throw you out, Pull you up by the roots from the land of life.","6":"Good people will watch and worship. They'll laugh in relief:","7":"\"Big Man bet on the wrong horse, trusted in big money, made his living from catastrophe.\"","8":"And I'm an olive tree, growing green in God's house. I trusted in the generous mercy of God then and now.","9":"I thank you always that you went into action. And I'll stay right here, your good name my hope, in company with your faithful friends."}
