{"1":"Quick, GOD, I need your helping hand! The last decent person just went down, All the friends I depended on gone.","2":"Everyone talks in lie language; Lies slide off their oily lips. They doubletalk with forked tongues.","3":"Slice their lips off their faces! Pull The braggart tongues from their mouths!","4":"I'm tired of hearing, \"We can talk anyone into anything! Our lips manage the world.\"","5":"Into the hovels of the poor, Into the dark streets where the homeless groan, God speaks: \"I've had enough; I'm on my way To heal the ache in the heart of the wretched.\"","6":"God's words are pure words, Pure silver words refined seven times In the fires of his word--kiln, Pure on earth as well as in heaven.","7":"GOD, keep us safe from their lies, From the wicked who stalk us with lies,","8":"From the wicked who collect honors For their wonderful lies."}
