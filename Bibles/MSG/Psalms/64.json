{"1":"Listen and help, O God. I'm reduced to a whine And a whimper, obsessed with feelings of doomsday.","2":"Don't let them find me--the conspirators out to get me,","3":"Using their tongues as weapons, flinging poison words, poison-tipped arrow-words.","4":"They shoot from ambush, shoot without warning, not caring who they hit.","5":"They keep fit doing calisthenics of evil purpose, They keep lists of the traps they've secretly set. They say to each other, \"No one can catch us,","6":"no one can detect our perfect crime.\" The Detective detects the mystery in the dark of the cellar heart.","7":"The God of the Arrow shoots! They double up in pain,","8":"Fall flat on their faces in full view of the grinning crowd.","9":"Everyone sees it. God's work is the talk of the town.","10":"Be glad, good people! Fly to GOD! Good-hearted people, make praise your habit."}
