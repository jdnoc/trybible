Because GOD chose Jacob, embraced Israel as a prize possession.","5":"I too give witness to the greatness of GOD, our Lord, high above all other gods.","6":"He does just as he pleases--however, wherever, whenever.","7":"He makes the weather--clouds and thunder, lightning and rain, wind pouring out of the north.","8":"He struck down the Egyptian firstborn, both human and animal firstborn.","9":"He made Egypt sit up and take notice, confronted Pharaoh and his servants with miracles.","10":"Yes, he struck down great nations, he slew mighty kings--","11":"Sihon king of the Amorites, also Og of Bashan--every last one of the Canaanite kings!","12":"Then he turned their land over to Israel, a gift of good land to his people.","13":"GOD, your name is eternal, GOD, you'll never be out--of-date.","14":"GOD stands up for his people, GOD holds the hands of his people.","15":"The gods of the godless nations are mere trinkets, made for quick sale in the markets:","16":"Chiseled mouths that can't talk, painted eyes that can't see,","17":"Carved ears that can't hear--dead wood! cold metal!","18":"Those who make and trust them become like them.","19":"Family of Israel, bless GOD! Family of Aaron, bless GOD!","20":"Family of Levi, bless GOD! You who fear GOD, bless GOD!","21":"Oh, blessed be GOD of Zion, First Citizen of Jerusalem! Hallelujah! al"}
