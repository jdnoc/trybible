{"1":"Listen, GOD! Please, pay attention! Can you make sense of these ramblings,","2":"my groans and cries? King-God, I need your help.","3":"Every morning you'll hear me at it again. Every morning I lay out the pieces of my life on your altar and watch for fire to descend.","4":"You don't socialize with Wicked, or invite Evil over as your houseguest.","5":"Hot-Air-Boaster collapses in front of you; you shake your head over Mischief-Maker.","6":"GOD destroys Lie-Speaker; Blood-Thirsty and Truth-Bender disgust you.","7":"And here I am, your invited guest--it's incredible! I enter your house; here I am, prostrate in your inner sanctum,","8":"Waiting for directions to get me safely through enemy lines.","9":"Every word they speak is a land mine; their lungs breathe out poison gas. Their throats are gaping graves, their tongues slick as mudslides.","10":"Pile on the guilt, God! Let their so-called wisdom wreck them. Kick them out! They've had their chance.","11":"But you'll welcome us with open arms when we run for cover to you. Let the party last all night! Stand guard over our celebration.","12":"You are famous, GOD, for welcoming God--seekers, for decking us out in delight."}
