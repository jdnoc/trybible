{"1":"I'm in trouble. I cry to GOD, desperate for an answer:","2":"\"Deliver me from the liars, GOD! They smile so sweetly but lie through their teeth.\"","3":"Do you know what's next, can you see what's coming, all you barefaced liars?","4":"Pointed arrows and burning coals will be your reward.","5":"I'm doomed to live in Meshech, cursed with a home in Kedar,","6":"My whole life lived camping among quarreling neighbors.","7":"I'm all for peace, but the minute I tell them so, they go to war!"}
