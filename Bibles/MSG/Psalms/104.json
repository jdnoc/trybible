{"1":"O my soul, bless GOD! GOD, my God, how great you are! beautifully, gloriously robed,","2":"Dressed up in sunshine, and all heaven stretched out for your tent.","3":"You built your palace on the ocean deeps, made a chariot out of clouds and took off on wind--wings.","4":"You commandeered winds as messengers, appointed fire and flame as ambassadors.","5":"You set earth on a firm foundation so that nothing can shake it, ever.","6":"You blanketed earth with ocean, covered the mountains with deep waters;","7":"Then you roared and the water ran away--your thunder crash put it to flight.","8":"Mountains pushed up, valleys spread out in the places you assigned them.","9":"You set boundaries between earth and sea; never again will earth be flooded.","10":"You started the springs and rivers, sent them flowing among the hills.","11":"All the wild animals now drink their fill, wild donkeys quench their thirst.","12":"Along the riverbanks the birds build nests, ravens make their voices heard.","13":"You water the mountains from your heavenly cisterns; earth is supplied with plenty of water.","14":"You make grass grow for the livestock, hay for the animals that plow the ground. Oh yes, God brings grain from the land,","15":"wine to make people happy, Their faces glowing with health, a people well-fed and hearty.","16":"GOD's trees are well-watered--the Lebanon cedars he planted.","17":"Birds build their nests in those trees; look--the stork at home in the treetop.","18":"Mountain goats climb about the cliffs; badgers burrow among the rocks.","19":"The moon keeps track of the seasons, the sun is in charge of each day.","20":"When it's dark and night takes over, all the forest creatures come out.","21":"The young lions roar for their prey, clamoring to God for their supper.","22":"When the sun comes up, they vanish, lazily stretched out in their dens.","23":"Meanwhile, men and women go out to work, busy at their jobs until evening.","24":"What a wildly wonderful world, GOD! You made it all, with Wisdom at your side, made earth overflow with your wonderful creations.","25":"Oh, look--the deep, wide sea, brimming with fish past counting, sardines and sharks and salmon.","26":"Ships plow those waters, and Leviathan, your pet dragon, romps in them.","27":"All the creatures look expectantly to you to give them their meals on time.","28":"You come, and they gather around; you open your hand and they eat from it.","29":"If you turned your back, they'd die in a minute--Take back your Spirit and they die, revert to original mud;","30":"Send out your Spirit and they spring to life--the whole countryside in bloom and blossom.","31":"The glory of GOD-let it last forever! Let GOD enjoy his creation!","32":"He takes one look at earth and triggers an earthquake, points a finger at the mountains, and volcanoes erupt.","33":"Oh, let me sing to GOD all my life long, sing hymns to my God as long as I live!","34":"Oh, let my song please him; I'm so pleased to be singing to GOD.","35":"But clear the ground of sinners--no more godless men and women! O my soul, bless GOD!"}
