{"1":"Hallelujah! You who serve GOD, praise GOD! Just to speak his name is praise!","2":"Just to remember GOD is a blessing--now and tomorrow and always.","3":"From east to west, from dawn to dusk, keep lifting all your praises to GOD!","4":"GOD is higher than anything and anyone, outshining everything you can see in the skies.","5":"Who can compare with GOD, our God, so majestically enthroned,","6":"Surveying his magnificent heavens and earth?","7":"He picks up the poor from out of the dirt, rescues the wretched who've been thrown out with the trash,","8":"Seats them among the honored guests, a place of honor among the brightest and best.","9":"He gives childless couples a family, gives them joy as the parents of children. Hallelujah! al"}
