{"1":"Listen, everyone, listen--earth-dwellers, don't miss this.","2":"All you haves and have-nots, All together now: listen.","3":"I set plainspoken wisdom before you, my heart-seasoned understandings of life.","4":"I fine-tuned my ear to the sayings of the wise, I solve life's riddle with the help of a harp.","5":"So why should I fear in bad times, hemmed in by enemy malice,","6":"Shoved around by bullies, demeaned by the arrogant rich?","7":"Really! There's no such thing as self-rescue, pulling yourself up by your bootstraps.","8":"The cost of rescue is beyond our means, and even then it doesn't guarantee","9":"Life forever, or insurance against the Black Hole.","10":"Anyone can see that the brightest and best die, wiped out right along with fools and dunces.","11":"They leave all their prowess behind, move into their new home, The Coffin, The cemetery their permanent address. And to think they named counties after themselves!","12":"We aren't immortal. We don't last long. Like our dogs, we age and weaken. And die.","13":"This is what happens to those who live for the moment, who only look out for themselves:","14":"Death herds them like sheep straight to hell; they disappear down the gullet of the grave; They waste away to nothing--nothing left but a marker in a cemetery.","15":"But me? God snatches me from the clutch of death, he reaches down and grabs me.","16":"So don't be impressed with those who get rich and pile up fame and fortune.","17":"They can't take it with them; fame and fortune all get left behind.","18":"Just when they think they've arrived and folks praise them because they've made good,","19":"They enter the family burial plot where they'll never see sunshine again.","20":"We aren't immortal. We don't last long. Like our dogs, we age and weaken. And die. An Asaph psalm"}
