Canaan is your hill-country inheritance.\"","12":"When they didn't count for much, a mere handful, and strangers at that,","13":"Wandering from country to country, drifting from pillar to post,","14":"He permitted no one to abuse them. He told kings to keep their hands off:","15":"\"Don't you dare lay a hand on my anointed, don't hurt a hair on the heads of my prophets.\"","16":"Then he called down a famine on the country, he broke every last blade of wheat.","17":"But he sent a man on ahead: Joseph, sold as a slave.","18":"They put cruel chains on his ankles, an iron collar around his neck,","19":"Until God's word came to the Pharaoh, and GOD confirmed his promise.","20":"God sent the king to release him. The Pharaoh set Joseph free;","21":"He appointed him master of his palace, put him in charge of all his business","22":"To personally instruct his princes and train his advisors in wisdom.","23":"Then Israel entered Egypt, Jacob immigrated to the Land of Ham.","24":"God gave his people lots of babies; soon their numbers alarmed their foes.","25":"He turned the Egyptians against his people; they abused and cheated God's servants.","26":"Then he sent his servant Moses, and Aaron, whom he also chose.","27":"They worked marvels in that spiritual wasteland, miracles in the Land of Ham.","28":"He spoke, \"Darkness!\" and it turned dark--they couldn't see what they were doing.","29":"He turned all their water to blood so that all their fish died;","30":"He made frogs swarm through the land, even into the king's bedroom;","31":"He gave the word and flies swarmed, gnats filled the air.","32":"He substituted hail for rain, he stabbed their land with lightning;","33":"He wasted their vines and fig trees, smashed their groves of trees to splinters;","34":"With a word he brought in locusts, millions of locusts, armies of locusts;","35":"They consumed every blade of grass in the country and picked the ground clean of produce;","36":"He struck down every firstborn in the land, the first fruits of their virile powers.","37":"He led Israel out, their arms filled with loot, and not one among his tribes even stumbled.","38":"Egypt was glad to have them go--they were scared to death of them.","39":"God spread a cloud to keep them cool through the day and a fire to light their way through the night;","40":"They prayed and he brought quail, filled them with the bread of heaven;","41":"He opened the rock and water poured out; it flowed like a river through that desert--","42":"All because he remembered his Covenant, his promise to Abraham, his servant.","43":"Remember this! He led his people out singing for joy; his chosen people marched, singing their hearts out!","44":"He made them a gift of the country they entered, helped them seize the wealth of the nations","45":"So they could do everything he told them--could follow his instructions to the letter.
