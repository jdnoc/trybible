{"1":"Count yourself lucky, how happy you must be--you get a fresh start, your slate's wiped clean.","2":"Count yourself lucky--GOD holds nothing against you and you're holding nothing back from him.","3":"When I kept it all inside, my bones turned to powder, my words became daylong groans.","4":"The pressure never let up; all the juices of my life dried up.","5":"Then I let it all out; I said, \"I'll make a clean breast of my failures to GOD.\" Suddenly the pressure was gone--my guilt dissolved, my sin disappeared.","6":"These things add up. Every one of us needs to pray; when all hell breaks loose and the dam bursts we'll be on high ground, untouched.","7":"GOD's my island hideaway, keeps danger far from the shore, throws garlands of hosannas around my neck.","8":"Let me give you some good advice; I'm looking you in the eye and giving it to you straight:","9":"\"Don't be ornery like a horse or mule that needs bit and bridle to stay on track.\"","10":"God--defiers are always in trouble; GOD-affirmers find themselves loved every time they turn around.","11":"Celebrate GOD. Sing together--everyone! All you honest hearts, raise the roof!"}
