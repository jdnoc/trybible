{"1":"God, listen to me shout, bend an ear to my prayer.","2":"When I'm far from anywhere, down to my last gasp, I call out, \"Guide me up High Rock Mountain!\"","3":"You've always given me breathing room, a place to get away from it all,","4":"A lifetime pass to your safe-house, an open invitation as your guest.","5":"You've always taken me seriously, God, made me welcome among those who know and love you.","6":"Let the days of the king add up to years and years of good rule.","7":"Set his throne in the full light of God; post Steady Love and Good Faith as lookouts,","8":"And I'll be the poet who sings your glory--and live what I sing every day."}
