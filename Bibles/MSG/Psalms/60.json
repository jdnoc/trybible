{"1":"God! you walked off and left us, kicked our defenses to bits And stalked off angry. Come back. Oh please, come back!","2":"You shook earth to the foundations, ripped open huge crevasses. Heal the breaks! Everything's coming apart at the seams.","3":"You made your people look doom in the face, then gave us cheap wine to drown our troubles.","4":"Then you planted a flag to rally your people, an unfurled flag to look to for courage.","5":"Now do something quickly, answer right now, so the one you love best is saved.","6":"That's when God spoke in holy splendor, \"Bursting with joy, I make a present of Shechem, I hand out Succoth Valley as a gift.","7":"Gilead's in my pocket, to say nothing of Manasseh. Ephraim's my hard hat, Judah my hammer;","8":"Moab's a scrub bucket, I mop the floor with Moab, Spit on Edom, rain fireworks all over Philistia.\"","9":"Who will take me to the thick of the fight? Who'll show me the road to Edom?","10":"You aren't giving up on us, are you, God? refusing to go out with our troops?","11":"Give us help for the hard task; human help is worthless.","12":"In God we'll do our very best; he'll flatten the opposition for good."}
