What amazing insights you've provided!","4":"Where in the world did you learn all this? How did you become so inspired?","5":"\"All the buried dead are in torment, and all who've been drowned in the deep, deep sea.","6":"Hell is ripped open before God, graveyards dug up and exposed.","7":"He spreads the skies over unformed space, hangs the earth out in empty space.","8":"He pours water into cumulus cloud-bags and the bags don't burst.","9":"He makes the moon wax and wane, putting it through its phases.","10":"He draws the horizon out over the ocean, sets a boundary between light and darkness.","11":"Thunder crashes and rumbles in the skies. Listen! It's God raising his voice!","12":"By his power he stills sea storms, by his wisdom he tames sea monsters.","13":"With one breath he clears the sky, with one finger he crushes the sea serpent.","14":"And this is only the beginning, a mere whisper of his rule.
