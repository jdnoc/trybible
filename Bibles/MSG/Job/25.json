Is there any place where his light doesn't shine?","4":"How can a mere mortal presume to stand up to God? How can an ordinary person pretend to be guiltless?","5":"Why, even the moon has its flaws, even the stars aren't perfect in God's eyes,","6":"So how much less, plain men and women--slugs and maggots by comparison!\" Job's Defense God Sets a Boundary Between Light and Darkness"}
