{"1":"Job replied:","2":"\"Now listen to me carefully, please listen, at least do me the favor of listening.","3":"Put up with me while I have my say--then you can mock me later to your heart's content.","4":"\"It's not you I'm complaining to--it's God. Is it any wonder I'm getting fed up with his silence?","5":"Take a good look at me. Aren't you appalled by what's happened? No! Don't say anything. I can do without your comments.","6":"When I look back, I go into shock, my body is racked with spasms.","7":"Why do the wicked have it so good, live to a ripe old age and get rich?","8":"They get to see their children succeed, get to watch and enjoy their grandchildren.","9":"Their homes are peaceful and free from fear; they never experience God's disciplining rod.","10":"Their bulls breed with great vigor and their cows calve without fail.","11":"They send their children out to play and watch them frolic like spring lambs.","12":"They make music with fiddles and flutes, have good times singing and dancing.","13":"They have a long life on easy street, and die painlessly in their sleep.","14":"They say to God, \"Get lost! We've no interest in you or your ways.","15":"Why should we have dealings with God Almighty? What's there in it for us?'","16":"But they're wrong, dead wrong--they're not gods. It's beyond me how they can carry on like this!","17":"\"Still, how often does it happen that the wicked fail, or disaster strikes, or they get their just deserts?","18":"How often are they blown away by bad luck? Not very often.","19":"You might say, \"God is saving up the punishment for their children.' I say, \"Give it to them right now so they'll know what they've done!'","20":"They deserve to experience the effects of their evil, feel the full force of God's wrath firsthand.","21":"What do they care what happens to their families after they're safely tucked away in the grave?","22":"\"But who are we to tell God how to run his affairs? He's dealing with matters that are way over our heads.","23":"Some people die in the prime of life, with everything going for them--","24":"fat and sassy.","25":"Others die bitter and bereft, never getting a taste of happiness.","26":"They're laid out side by side in the cemetery, where the worms can't tell one from the other.","27":"\"I'm not deceived. I know what you're up to, the plans you're cooking up to bring me down.","28":"Naively you claim that the castles of tyrants fall to pieces, that the achievements of the wicked collapse.","29":"Have you ever asked world travelers how they see it? Have you not listened to their stories","30":"Of evil men and women who got off scot-free, who never had to pay for their wickedness?","31":"Did anyone ever confront them with their crimes? Did they ever have to face the music?","32":"Not likely--they're given fancy funerals with all the trimmings,","33":"Gently lowered into expensive graves, with everyone telling lies about how wonderful they were.","34":"\"So how do you expect me to get any comfort from your nonsense? Your so-called comfort is a tissue of lies.\" Eliphaz Attacks Job--The Third Round Come to Terms with God"}
