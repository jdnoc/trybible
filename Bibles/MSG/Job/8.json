{"1":"Bildad from Shuhah was next to speak:","2":"\"How can you keep on talking like this? You're talking nonsense, and noisy nonsense at that.","3":"Does God mess up? Does God Almighty ever get things backwards?","4":"It's plain that your children sinned against him--otherwise, why would God have punished them?","5":"Here's what you must do--and don't put it off any longer: Get down on your knees before God Almighty.","6":"If you're as innocent and upright as you say, it's not too late--he'll come running; he'll set everything right again, reestablish your fortunes.","7":"Even though you're not much right now, you'll end up better than ever.","8":"\"Put the question to our ancestors, study what they learned from their ancestors.","9":"For we're newcomers at this, with a lot to learn, and not too long to learn it.","10":"So why not let the ancients teach you, tell you what's what, instruct you in what they knew from experience?","11":"Can mighty pine trees grow tall without soil? Can luscious tomatoes flourish without water?","12":"Blossoming flowers look great before they're cut or picked, but without soil or water they wither more quickly than grass.","13":"That's what happens to all who forget God--all their hopes come to nothing.","14":"They hang their life from one thin thread, they hitch their fate to a spider web.","15":"One jiggle and the thread breaks, one jab and the web collapses.","16":"Or they're like weeds springing up in the sunshine, invading the garden,","17":"Spreading everywhere, overtaking the flowers, getting a foothold even in the rocks.","18":"But when the gardener rips them out by the roots, the garden doesn't miss them one bit.","19":"The sooner the godless are gone, the better; then good plants can grow in their place.","20":"\"There's no way that God will reject a good person, and there is no way he'll help a bad one.","21":"God will let you laugh again; you'll raise the roof with shouts of joy,","22":"With your enemies thoroughly discredited, their house of cards collapsed.\" HKJob ContinuesHK How Can Mere Mortals Get Right with God?"}
