{"1":"Eliphaz of Teman spoke a second time:","2":"\"If you were truly wise, would you sound so much like a windbag, belching hot air?","3":"Would you talk nonsense in the middle of a serious argument, babbling baloney?","4":"Look at you! You trivialize religion, turn spiritual conversation into empty gossip.","5":"It's your sin that taught you to talk this way. You chose an education in fraud.","6":"Your own words have exposed your guilt. It's nothing I've said--you've incriminated yourself!","7":"Do you think you're the first person to have to deal with these things? Have you been around as long as the hills?","8":"Were you listening in when God planned all this? Do you think you're the only one who knows anything?","9":"What do you know that we don't know? What insights do you have that we've missed?","10":"Gray beards and white hair back us up--old folks who've been around a lot longer than you.","11":"Are God's promises not enough for you, spoken so gently and tenderly?","12":"Why do you let your emotions take over, lashing out and spitting fire,","13":"Pitting your whole being against God by letting words like this come out of your mouth?","14":"Do you think it's possible for any mere mortal to be sinless in God's sight, for anyone born of a human mother to get it all together?","15":"Why, God can't even trust his holy angels. He sees the flaws in the very heavens themselves,","16":"So how much less we humans, smelly and foul, who lap up evil like water?","17":"\"I've a thing or two to tell you, so listen up! I'm letting you in on my views;","18":"It's what wise men and women have always taught, holding nothing back from what they were taught","19":"By their parents, back in the days when they had this land all to themselves:","20":"Those who live by their own rules, not God's, can expect nothing but trouble, and the longer they live, the worse it gets.","21":"Every little sound terrifies them. Just when they think they have it made, disaster strikes.","22":"They despair of things ever getting better--they're on the list of people for whom things always turn out for the worst.","23":"They wander here and there, never knowing where the next meal is coming from--every day is doomsday!","24":"They live in constant terror, always with their backs up against the wall","25":"Because they insist on shaking their fists at God, defying God Almighty to his face,","26":"Always and ever at odds with God, always on the defensive.","27":"\"Even if they're the picture of health, trim and fit and youthful,","28":"They'll end up living in a ghost town sleeping in a hovel not fit for a dog, a ramshackle shack.","29":"They'll never get ahead, never amount to a hill of beans.","30":"And then death--don't think they'll escape that! They'll end up shriveled weeds, brought down by a puff of God's breath.","31":"There's a lesson here: Whoever invests in lies, gets lies for interest,","32":"Paid in full before the due date. Some investment!","33":"They'll be like fruit frost-killed before it ripens, like buds sheared off before they bloom.","34":"The godless are fruitless--a barren crew; a life built on bribes goes up in smoke.","35":"They have sex with sin and give birth to evil. Their lives are wombs for breeding deceit.\" HKJob Defends HimselfHK If You Were in My Shoes"}
