{"1":"Elihu lit into Job again:","2":"\"Does this kind of thing make any sense? First you say, \"I'm perfectly innocent before God.'","3":"And then you say, \"It doesn't make a bit of difference whether I've sinned or not.'","4":"\"Well, I'm going to show you that you don't know what you're talking about, neither you nor your friends.","5":"Look up at the sky. Take a long hard look. See those clouds towering above you?","6":"If you sin, what difference could that make to God? No matter how much you sin, will it matter to him?","7":"Even if you're good, what would God get out of that? Do you think he's dependent on your accomplishments?","8":"The only ones who care whether you're good or bad are your family and friends and neighbors. God's not dependent on your behavior.","9":"\"When times get bad, people cry out for help. They cry for relief from being kicked around,","10":"But never give God a thought when things go well, when God puts spontaneous songs in their hearts,","11":"When God sets out the entire creation as a science classroom, using birds and beasts to teach wisdom.","12":"People are arrogantly indifferent to God--until, of course, they're in trouble, and then God is indifferent to them.","13":"There's nothing behind such prayers except panic; the Almighty pays them no mind.","14":"So why would he notice you just because you say you're tired of waiting to be heard,","15":"Or waiting for him to get good and angry and do something about the world's problems?","16":"\"Job, you talk sheer nonsense--nonstop nonsense!\""}
