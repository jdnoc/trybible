{"1":"\"Yes, I've seen all this with my own eyes, heard and understood it with my very own ears.","2":"Everything you know, I know, so I'm not taking a back seat to any of you.","3":"I'm taking my case straight to God Almighty; I've had it with you--I'm going directly to God.","4":"You graffiti my life with lies. You're a bunch of pompous quacks!","5":"I wish you'd shut your mouths--silence is your only claim to wisdom.","6":"\"Listen now while I make my case, consider my side of things for a change.","7":"Or are you going to keep on lying \"to do God a service'? to make up stories \"to get him off the hook'?","8":"Why do you always take his side? Do you think he needs a lawyer to defend himself?","9":"How would you fare if you were in the dock? Your lies might convince a jury--but would they convince God?","10":"He'd reprimand you on the spot if he detected a bias in your witness.","11":"Doesn't his splendor put you in awe? Aren't you afraid to speak cheap lies before him?","12":"Your wise sayings are knickknack wisdom, good for nothing but gathering dust.","13":"\"So hold your tongue while I have my say, then I'll take whatever I have coming to me.","14":"Why do I go out on a limb like this and take my life in my hands?","15":"Because even if he killed me, I'd keep on hoping. I'd defend my innocence to the very end.","16":"Just wait, this is going to work out for the best--my salvation! If I were guilt-stricken do you think I'd be doing this--laying myself on the line before God?","17":"You'd better pay attention to what I'm telling you, listen carefully with both ears.","18":"Now that I've laid out my defense, I'm sure that I'll be acquitted.","19":"Can anyone prove charges against me? I've said my piece. I rest my case.","20":"\"Please, God, I have two requests; grant them so I'll know I count with you:","21":"First, lay off the afflictions; the terror is too much for me.","22":"Second, address me directly so I can answer you, or let me speak and then you answer me.","23":"How many sins have been charged against me? Show me the list--how bad is it?","24":"Why do you stay hidden and silent? Why treat me like I'm your enemy?","25":"Why kick me around like an old tin can? Why beat a dead horse?","26":"You compile a long list of mean things about me, even hold me accountable for the sins of my youth.","27":"You hobble me so I can't move about. You watch every move I make, and brand me as a dangerous character.","28":"\"Like something rotten, human life fast decomposes, like a moth-eaten shirt or a mildewed blouse."}
