{"1":"Job answered:","2":"\"I'm sure you speak for all the experts, and when you die there'll be no one left to tell us how to live.","3":"But don't forget that I also have a brain--I don't intend to play second fiddle to you. It doesn't take an expert to know these things.","4":"\"I'm ridiculed by my friends: \"So that's the man who had conversations with God!' Ridiculed without mercy: \"Look at the man who never did wrong!'","5":"It's easy for the well-to-do to point their fingers in blame, for the well-fixed to pour scorn on the strugglers.","6":"Crooks reside safely in high-security houses, insolent blasphemers live in luxury; they've bought and paid for a god who'll protect them.","7":"\"But ask the animals what they think--let them teach you; let the birds tell you what's going on.","8":"Put your ear to the earth--learn the basics. Listen--the fish in the ocean will tell you their stories.","9":"Isn't it clear that they all know and agree that GOD is sovereign, that he holds all things in his hand--","10":"Every living soul, yes, every breathing creature?","11":"Isn't this all just common sense, as common as the sense of taste?","12":"Do you think the elderly have a corner on wisdom, that you have to grow old before you understand life?","13":"\"True wisdom and real power belong to God; from him we learn how to live, and also what to live for.","14":"If he tears something down, it's down for good; if he locks people up, they're locked up for good.","15":"If he holds back the rain, there's a drought; if he lets it loose, there's a flood.","16":"Strength and success belong to God; both deceived and deceiver must answer to him.","17":"He strips experts of their vaunted credentials, exposes judges as witless fools.","18":"He divests kings of their royal garments, then ties a rag around their waists.","19":"He strips priests of their robes, and fires high officials from their jobs.","20":"He forces trusted sages to keep silence, deprives elders of their good sense and wisdom.","21":"He dumps contempt on famous people, disarms the strong and mighty.","22":"He shines a spotlight into caves of darkness, hauls deepest darkness into the noonday sun.","23":"He makes nations rise and then fall, builds up some and abandons others.","24":"He robs world leaders of their reason, and sends them off into no man's land.","25":"They grope in the dark without a clue, lurching and staggering like drunks."}
