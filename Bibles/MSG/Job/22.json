{"1":"Once again Eliphaz the Temanite took up his theme:","2":"\"Are any of us strong enough to give God a hand, or smart enough to give him advice?","3":"So what if you were righteous--would God Almighty even notice? Even if you gave a perfect performance, do you think he'd applaud?","4":"Do you think it's because he cares about your purity that he's disciplining you, putting you on the spot?","5":"Hardly! It's because you're a first-class moral failure, because there's no end to your sins.","6":"When people came to you for help, you took the shirts off their backs, exploited their helplessness.","7":"You wouldn't so much as give a drink to the thirsty, or food, not even a scrap, to the hungry.","8":"And there you sat, strong and honored by everyone, surrounded by immense wealth!","9":"You turned poor widows away from your door; heartless, you crushed orphans.","10":"Now you're the one trapped in terror, paralyzed by fear. Suddenly the tables have turned!","11":"How do you like living in the dark, sightless, up to your neck in flood waters?","12":"\"You agree, don't you, that God is in charge? He runs the universe--just look at the stars!","13":"Yet you dare raise questions: \"What does God know? From that distance and darkness, how can he judge?","14":"He roams the heavens wrapped in clouds, so how can he see us?'","15":"\"Are you going to persist in that tired old line that wicked men and women have always used?","16":"Where did it get them? They died young, flash floods sweeping them off to their doom.","17":"They told God, \"Get lost! What good is God Almighty to us?'","18":"And yet it was God who gave them everything they had. It's beyond me how they can carry on like this!","19":"\"Good people see bad people crash, and call for a celebration. Relieved, they crow,","20":"\"At last! Our enemies--wiped out. Everything they had and stood for is up in smoke!'","21":"\"Give in to God, come to terms with him and everything will turn out just fine.","22":"Let him tell you what to do; take his words to heart.","23":"Come back to God Almighty and he'll rebuild your life. Clean house of everything evil.","24":"Relax your grip on your money and abandon your gold-plated luxury.","25":"God Almighty will be your treasure, more wealth than you can imagine.","26":"\"You'll take delight in God, the Mighty One, and look to him joyfully, boldly.","27":"You'll pray to him and he'll listen; he'll help you do what you've promised.","28":"You'll decide what you want and it will happen; your life will be bathed in light.","29":"To those who feel low you'll say, \"Chin up! Be brave!' and God will save them.","30":"Yes, even the guilty will escape, escape through God's grace in your life.\" Job's Defense I'm Completely in the Dark"}
