{"1":"Then Job broke the silence. He spoke up and cursed his fate:","3":"\"Obliterate the day I was born. Blank out the night I was conceived!","4":"Let it be a black hole in space. May God above forget it ever happened. Erase it from the books!","5":"May the day of my birth be buried in deep darkness, shrouded by the fog, swallowed by the night.","6":"And the night of my conception--the devil take it! Rip the date off the calendar, delete it from the almanac.","7":"Oh, turn that night into pure nothingness--no sounds of pleasure from that night, ever!","8":"May those who are good at cursing curse that day. Unleash the sea beast, Leviathan, on it.","9":"May its morning stars turn to black cinders, waiting for a daylight that never comes, never once seeing the first light of dawn.","10":"And why? Because it released me from my mother's womb into a life with so much trouble.","11":"\"Why didn't I die at birth, my first breath out of the womb my last?","12":"Why were there arms to rock me, and breasts for me to drink from?","13":"I could be resting in peace right now, asleep forever, feeling no pain,","14":"In the company of kings and statesmen in their royal ruins,","15":"Or with princes resplendent in their gold and silver tombs.","16":"Why wasn't I stillborn and buried with all the babies who never saw light,","17":"Where the wicked no longer trouble anyone and bone-weary people get a long-deserved rest?","18":"Prisoners sleep undisturbed, never again to wake up to the bark of the guards.","19":"The small and the great are equals in that place, and slaves are free from their masters.","20":"\"Why does God bother giving light to the miserable, why bother keeping bitter people alive,","21":"Those who want in the worst way to die, and can't, who can't imagine anything better than death,","22":"Who count the day of their death and burial the happiest day of their life?","23":"What's the point of life when it doesn't make sense, when God blocks all the roads to meaning?","24":"\"Instead of bread I get groans for my supper, then leave the table and vomit my anguish.","25":"The worst of my fears has come true, what I've dreaded most has happened.","26":"My repose is shattered, my peace destroyed. No rest for me, ever--death has invaded life.\" Eliphaz Speaks Out Now You're the One in Trouble"}
