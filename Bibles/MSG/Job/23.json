{"1":"Job replied:","2":"\"I'm not letting up--I'm standing my ground. My complaint is legitimate. God has no right to treat me like this--it isn't fair!","3":"If I knew where on earth to find him, I'd go straight to him.","4":"I'd lay my case before him face-to-face, give him all my arguments firsthand.","5":"I'd find out exactly what he's thinking, discover what's going on in his head.","6":"Do you think he'd dismiss me or bully me? No, he'd take me seriously.","7":"He'd see a straight--living man standing before him; my Judge would acquit me for good of all charges.","8":"\"I travel East looking for him--I find no one; then West, but not a trace;","9":"I go North, but he's hidden his tracks; then South, but not even a glimpse.","10":"\"But he knows where I am and what I've done. He can cross-examine me all he wants, and I'll pass the test with honors.","11":"I've followed him closely, my feet in his footprints, not once swerving from his way.","12":"I've obeyed every word he's spoken, and not just obeyed his advice--I've treasured it.","13":"\"But he is singular and sovereign. Who can argue with him? He does what he wants, when he wants to.","14":"He'll complete in detail what he's decided about me, and whatever else he determines to do.","15":"Is it any wonder that I dread meeting him? Whenever I think about it, I get scared all over again.","16":"God makes my heart sink! God Almighty gives me the shudders!","17":"I'm completely in the dark, I can't see my hand in front of my face."}
