{"1":"\"I can't stand my life--I hate it! -I'm putting it all out on the table,\tall the bitterness of my life--I'm holding back nothing.\"","2":"Job prayed: \"Here's what I want to say: Don't, God, bring in a verdict of guilty without letting me know the charges you're bringing.","3":"How does this fit into what you once called \"good'--giving me a hard time, spurning me, a life you shaped by your very own hands, and then blessing the plots of the wicked?","4":"You don't look at things the way we mortals do. You're not taken in by appearances, are you?","5":"Unlike us, you're not working against a deadline. You have all eternity to work things out.","6":"So what's this all about, anyway--this compulsion to dig up some dirt, to find some skeleton in my closet?","7":"You know good and well I'm not guilty. You also know no one can help me.","8":"\"You made me like a handcrafted piece of pottery--and now are you going to smash me to pieces?","9":"Don't you remember how beautifully you worked my clay? Will you reduce me now to a mud pie?","10":"Oh, that marvel of conception as you stirred together semen and ovum--","11":"What a miracle of skin and bone, muscle and brain!","12":"You gave me life itself, and incredible love. You watched and guarded every breath I took.","13":"\"But you never told me about this part. I should have known that there was more to it--","14":"That if I so much as missed a step, you'd notice and pounce, wouldn't let me get by with a thing.","15":"If I'm truly guilty, I'm doomed. But if I'm innocent, it's no better--I'm still doomed. My belly is full of bitterness. I'm up to my ears in a swamp of affliction.","16":"I try to make the best of it, try to brave it out, but you're too much for me, relentless, like a lion on the prowl.","17":"You line up fresh witnesses against me. You compound your anger and pile on the grief and pain!","18":"\"So why did you have me born? I wish no one had ever laid eyes on me!","19":"I wish I'd never lived--a stillborn, buried without ever having breathed.","20":"Isn't it time to call it quits on my life? Can't you let up, and let me smile just once","21":"Before I die and am buried, before I'm nailed into my coffin, sealed in the ground,","22":"And banished for good to the land of the dead, blind in the final dark?\" HKZophar's CounselHK How Wisdom Looks from the Inside"}
