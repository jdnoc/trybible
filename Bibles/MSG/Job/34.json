{"1":"Elihu continued:","2":"\"So, my fine friends--listen to me, and see what you think of this.","3":"Isn't it just common sense--as common as the sense of taste--","4":"To put our heads together and figure out what's going on here?","5":"\"We've all heard Job say, \"I'm in the right, but God won't give me a fair trial.","6":"When I defend myself, I'm called a liar to my face. I've done nothing wrong, and I get punished anyway.'","7":"Have you ever heard anything to beat this? Does nothing faze this man Job?","8":"Do you think he's spent too much time in bad company, hanging out with the wrong crowd,","9":"So that now he's parroting their line: \"It doesn't pay to try to please God'?","10":"\"You're veterans in dealing with these matters; certainly we're of one mind on this. It's impossible for God to do anything evil; no way can the Mighty One do wrong.","11":"He makes us pay for exactly what we've done--no more, no less. Our chickens always come home to roost.","12":"It's impossible for God to do anything wicked, for the Mighty One to subvert justice.","13":"He's the one who runs the earth! He cradles the whole world in his hand!","14":"If he decided to hold his breath,","15":"every man, woman, and child would die for lack of air.","16":"\"So, Job, use your head; this is all pretty obvious.","17":"Can someone who hates order, keep order? Do you dare condemn the righteous, mighty God?","18":"Doesn't God always tell it like it is, exposing corrupt rulers as scoundrels and criminals?","19":"Does he play favorites with the rich and famous and slight the poor? Isn't he equally responsible to everybody?","20":"Don't people who deserve it die without notice? Don't wicked rulers tumble to their doom? When the so-called great ones are wiped out, we know God is working behind the scenes.","21":"\"He has his eyes on every man and woman. He doesn't miss a trick.","22":"There is no night dark enough, no shadow deep enough, to hide those who do evil.","23":"God doesn't need to gather any more evidence; their sin is an open-and-shut case.","24":"He deposes the so-called high and mighty without asking questions, and replaces them at once with others.","25":"Nobody gets by with anything; overnight, judgment is signed, sealed, and delivered.","26":"He punishes the wicked for their wickedness out in the open where everyone can see it,","27":"Because they quit following him, no longer even thought about him or his ways.","28":"Their apostasy was announced by the cry of the poor; the cry of the afflicted got God's attention. Because You Refuse to Live on God's Terms","29":"\"If God is silent, what's that to you? If he turns his face away, what can you do about it? But whether silent or hidden, he's there, ruling,","30":"so that those who hate God won't take over and ruin people's lives.","31":"\"So why don't you simply confess to God? Say, \"I sinned, but I'll sin no more.","32":"Teach me to see what I still don't see. Whatever evil I've done, I'll do it no more.'","33":"Just because you refuse to live on God's terms, do you think he should start living on yours? You choose. I can't do it for you. Tell me what you decide.","34":"\"All right-thinking people say--and the wise who have listened to me concur--","35":"\"Job is an ignoramus. He talks utter nonsense.'","36":"Job, you need to be pushed to the wall and called to account for wickedly talking back to God the way you have.","37":"You've compounded your original sin by rebelling against God's discipline, Defiantly shaking your fist at God, piling up indictments against the Almighty One.\" Elihu's Third Speech When God Makes Creation a Classroom"}
