{"1":"Going through a long line of prophets, God has been addressing our ancestors in different ways for centuries.","2":"Recently he spoke to us directly through his Son. By his Son, God created the world in the beginning, and it will all belong to the Son at the end.","3":"This Son perfectly mirrors God, and is stamped with God's nature. He holds everything together by what he says--powerful words! After he finished the sacrifice for sins, the Son took his honored place high in the heavens right alongside God,","4":"far higher than any angel in rank and rule.","5":"Did God ever say to an angel, \"You're my Son; today I celebrate you\"? Or, \"I'm his Father, he's my Son\"?","6":"When he presents his honored Son to the world, he says, \"All angels must worship him.\"","7":"Regarding angels he says, The messengers are winds, the servants are tongues of fire.","8":"But he says to the Son, You're God, and on the throne for good; your rule makes everything right.","9":"You love it when things are right; you hate it when things are wrong. That is why God, your God, poured fragrant oil on your head, Marking you out as king, far above your dear companions.","10":"And again to the Son, You, Master, started it all, laid earth's foundations, then crafted the stars in the sky.","11":"Earth and sky will wear out, but not you; they become threadbare like an old coat;","12":"You'll fold them up like a worn-out cloak, and lay them away on the shelf. But you'll stay the same, year after year; you'll never fade, you'll never wear out.","13":"And did he ever say anything like this to an angel? Sit alongside me here on my throne Until I make your enemies a stool for your feet.","14":"Isn't it obvious that all angels are sent to help out with those lined up to receive salvation?"}
