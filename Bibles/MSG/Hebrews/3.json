{"1":"So, my dear Christian friends, companions in following this call to the heights, take a good hard look at Jesus. He's the centerpiece of everything we believe,","2":"faithful in everything God gave him to do. Moses was also faithful,","3":"but Jesus gets far more honor. A builder is more valuable than a building any day.","4":"Every house has a builder, but the Builder behind them all is God.","5":"Moses did a good job in God's house, but it was all servant work, getting things ready for what was to come.","6":"Christ as Son is in charge of the house. Now, if we can only keep a firm grip on this bold confidence, we're the house!","7":"That's why the Holy Spirit says, Today, please listen;","8":"don't turn a deaf ear as in \"the bitter uprising,\" that time of wilderness testing!","9":"Even though they watched me at work for forty years, your ancestors refused to let me do it my way; over and over they tried my patience.","10":"And I was provoked, oh, so provoked! I said, \"They'll never keep their minds on God; they refuse to walk down my road.\"","11":"Exasperated, I vowed, \"They'll never get where they're going, never be able to sit down and rest.\"","12":"So watch your step, friends. Make sure there's no evil unbelief lying around that will trip you up and throw you off course, diverting you from the living God.","13":"For as long as it's still God's Today, keep each other on your toes so sin doesn't slow down your reflexes.","14":"If we can only keep our grip on the sure thing we started out with, we're in this with Christ for the long haul.","15":"These words keep ringing in our ears: Today, please listen; don't turn a deaf ear as in the bitter uprising.","16":"For who were the people who turned a deaf ear? Weren't they the very ones Moses led out of Egypt?","17":"And who was God provoked with for forty years? Wasn't it those who turned a deaf ear and ended up corpses in the wilderness?","18":"And when he swore that they'd never get where they were going, wasn't he talking to the ones who turned a deaf ear?","19":"They never got there because they never listened, never believed."}
