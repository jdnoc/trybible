{"1":"GOD spoke to Moses:","2":"\"On the first day of the first month, set up The Dwelling, the Tent of Meeting.","3":"Place the Chest of The Testimony in it and screen the Chest with the curtain.","4":"\"Bring in the Table and set it, arranging its Lampstand and lamps.","5":"\"Place the Gold Altar of Incense before the Chest of The Testimony and hang the curtain at the door of The Dwelling.","6":"\"Place the Altar of Whole-Burnt-Offering at the door of The Dwelling, the Tent of Meeting.","7":"\"Place the Washbasin between the Tent of Meeting and the Altar and fill it with water.","8":"\"Set up the Courtyard on all sides and hang the curtain at the entrance to the Courtyard.","9":"\"Then take the anointing oil and anoint The Dwelling and everything in it; consecrate it and all its furnishings so that it becomes holy.","10":"Anoint the Altar of Whole-Burnt-Offering and all its utensils, consecrating the Altar so that it is completely holy.","11":"Anoint the Washbasin and its base: consecrate it.","12":"\"Finally, bring Aaron and his sons to the entrance of the Tent of Meeting and wash them with water.","13":"Dress Aaron in the sacred vestments. Anoint him. Consecrate him to serve me as priest.","14":"Bring his sons and put tunics on them.","15":"Anoint them, just as you anointed their father, to serve me as priests. Their anointing will bring them into a perpetual priesthood, down through the generations.\"","16":"Moses did everything GOD commanded. He did it all.","17":"On the first day of the first month of the second year, The Dwelling was set up.","18":"Moses set it up: He laid its bases, erected the frames, placed the crossbars, set the posts,","19":"spread the tent over The Dwelling, and put the covering over the tent, just as GOD had commanded Moses.","20":"He placed The Testimony in the Chest, inserted the poles for carrying the Chest, and placed the lid, the Atonement-Cover, on it.","21":"He brought the Chest into The Dwelling and set up the curtain, screening off the Chest of The Testimony, just as GOD had commanded Moses.","22":"He placed the Table in the Tent of Meeting on the north side of The Dwelling, outside the curtain,","23":"and arranged the Bread there before GOD, just as GOD had commanded him.","24":"He placed the Lampstand in the Tent of Meeting opposite the Table on the south side of The Dwelling","25":"and set up the lamps before GOD, just as GOD had commanded him.","26":"Moses placed the Gold Altar in the Tent of Meeting in front of the curtain","27":"and burned fragrant incense on it, just as GOD had commanded him.","28":"He placed the screen at the entrance to The Dwelling.","29":"He set the Altar of Whole-Burnt-Offering at the door of The Dwelling, the Tent of Meeting, and offered up the Whole-Burnt-Offerings and the Grain-Offerings, just as GOD had commanded Moses.","30":"He placed the Washbasin between the Tent of Meeting and the Altar, and filled it with water for washing.","31":"Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and feet there.","32":"When they entered the Tent of Meeting and when they served at the Altar, they washed, just as GOD had commanded Moses.","33":"Finally, he erected the Courtyard all around The Dwelling and the Altar, and put up the screen for the Courtyard entrance. Moses finished the work.","34":"The Cloud covered the Tent of Meeting, and the Glory of GOD filled The Dwelling.","35":"Moses couldn't enter the Tent of Meeting because the Cloud was upon it, and the Glory of GOD filled The Dwelling.","36":"Whenever the Cloud lifted from The Dwelling, the People of Israel set out on their travels,","37":"but if the Cloud did not lift, they wouldn't set out until it did lift.","38":"The Cloud of GOD was over The Dwelling during the day and the fire was in it at night, visible to all the Israelites in all their travels."}
