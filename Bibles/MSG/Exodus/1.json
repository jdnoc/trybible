{"1":"These are the names of the Israelites who went to Egypt with Jacob, each bringing his family members:","2":"Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,","3":"Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,","4":"Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher.","5":"Seventy persons in all generated by Jacob's seed. Joseph was already in Egypt.","6":"Then Joseph died, and all his brothers-that whole generation.","7":"But the children of Israel kept on reproducing. They were very prolific--a population explosion in their own right--and the land was filled with them.","8":"A new king came to power in Egypt who didn't know Joseph.","9":"He spoke to his people in alarm, \"There are way too many of these Israelites for us to handle.","10":"We've got to do something: Let's devise a plan to contain them, lest if there's a war they should join our enemies, or just walk off and leave us.\"","11":"So they organized them into work-gangs and put them to hard labor under gang-foremen. They built the storage cities Pithom and Rameses for Pharaoh.","12":"But the harder the Egyptians worked them the more children the Israelites had--children everywhere! The Egyptians got so they couldn't stand the Israelites","13":"and treated them worse than ever, crushing them with slave labor.","14":"They made them miserable with hard labor--making bricks and mortar and back-breaking work in the fields. They piled on the work, crushing them under the cruel workload.","15":"The king of Egypt had a talk with the two Hebrew midwives; one was named Shiphrah and the other Puah.","16":"He said, \"When you deliver the Hebrew women, look at the sex of the baby. If it's a boy, kill him; if it's a girl, let her live.\"","17":"But the midwives had far too much respect for God and didn't do what the king of Egypt ordered; they let the boy babies live.","18":"The king of Egypt called in the midwives. \"Why didn't you obey my orders? You've let those babies live!\"","19":"The midwives answered Pharaoh, \"The Hebrew women aren't like the Egyptian women; they're vigorous. Before the midwife can get there, they've already had the baby.\"","20":"God was pleased with the midwives. The people continued to increase in number--a very strong people.","21":"And because the midwives honored God, God gave them families of their own.","22":"So Pharaoh issued a general order to all his people: \"Every boy that is born, drown him in the Nile. But let the girls live.\""}
