{"1":"A man from the family of Levi married a Levite woman.","2":"The woman became pregnant and had a son. She saw there was something special about him and hid him. She hid him for three months.","3":"When she couldn't hide him any longer she got a little basket-boat made of papyrus, waterproofed it with tar and pitch, and placed the child in it. Then she set it afloat in the reeds at the edge of the Nile.","4":"The baby's older sister found herself a vantage point a little way off and watched to see what would happen to him.","5":"Pharaoh's daughter came down to the Nile to bathe; her maidens strolled on the bank. She saw the basket-boat floating in the reeds and sent her maid to get it.","6":"She opened it and saw the child--a baby crying! Her heart went out to him. She said, \"This must be one of the Hebrew babies.\"","7":"Then his sister was before her: \"Do you want me to go and get a nursing mother from the Hebrews so she can nurse the baby for you?\"","8":"Pharaoh's daughter said, \"Yes. Go.\" The girl went and called the child's mother.","9":"Pharaoh's daughter told her, \"Take this baby and nurse him for me. I'll pay you.\" The woman took the child and nursed him.","10":"After the child was weaned, she presented him to Pharaoh's daughter who adopted him as her son. She named him Moses (Pulled-Out), saying, \"I pulled him out of the water.\"","11":"Time passed. Moses grew up. One day he went and saw his brothers, saw all that hard labor. Then he saw an Egyptian hit a Hebrew--one of his relatives!","12":"He looked this way and then that; when he realized there was no one in sight, he killed the Egyptian and buried him in the sand.","13":"The next day he went out there again. Two Hebrew men were fighting. He spoke to the man who started it: \"Why are you hitting your neighbor?\"","14":"The man shot back: \"Who do you think you are, telling us what to do? Are you going to kill me the way you killed that Egyptian?\" Then Moses panicked: \"Word's gotten out--people know about this.\" [JC]","15":"Pharaoh heard about it and tried to kill Moses, but Moses got away to the land of Midian. He sat down by a well.","16":"The priest of Midian had seven daughters. They came and drew water, filling the troughs and watering their father's sheep.","17":"When some shepherds came and chased the girls off, Moses came to their rescue and helped them water their sheep.","18":"When they got home to their father, Reuel, he said, \"That didn't take long. Why are you back so soon?\"","19":"\"An Egyptian,\" they said, \"rescued us from a bunch of shepherds. Why, he even drew water for us and watered the sheep.\"","20":"He said, \"So where is he? Why did you leave him behind? Invite him so he can have something to eat with us.\"","21":"Moses agreed to settle down there with the man, who then gave his daughter Zipporah (Bird) to him for his wife.","22":"She had a son, and Moses named him Gershom (Sojourner), saying, \"I'm a sojourner in a foreign country.\" [JC]","23":"Many years later the king of Egypt died. The Israelites groaned under their slavery and cried out. Their cries for relief from their hard labor ascended to God:","24":"God listened to their groanings. God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.","25":"God saw what was going on with Israel. God understood. [JC]"}
