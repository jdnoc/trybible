{"1":"\"Make The Dwelling itself from ten panels of tapestry woven from fine twisted linen, blue and purple and scarlet material, with an angel-cherubim design. A skilled craftsman should do it.","2":"The panels of tapestry are each to be forty-six feet long and six feet wide.","3":"Join five of the panels together, and then the other five together.","4":"Make loops of blue along the edge of the outside panel of the first set and the same on the outside panel of the second set.","5":"Make fifty loops on each panel.","6":"Then make fifty gold clasps and join the tapestries together so that The Dwelling is one whole.","7":"\"Next make tapestries of goat hair for a tent that will cover The Dwelling. Make eleven panels of these tapestries.","8":"The length of each panel will be forty-five feet long and six feet wide.","9":"Join five of the panels together, and then the other six. Fold the sixth panel double at the front of the tent.","10":"Now make fifty loops along the edge of the end panel and fifty loops along the edge of the joining panel.","11":"Make fifty clasps of bronze and connect the clasps with the loops, bringing the tent together.","12":"\"Hang half of the overlap of the tapestry panels over the rear of The Dwelling.","13":"The eighteen inches of overlap on either side will cover the sides of the tent.","14":"Finally, make a covering for the tapestries of tanned rams' skins dyed red and over that a covering of dolphin skins.","15":"\"Frame The Dwelling with planks of acacia wood,","16":"each section of frame fifteen feet long and two and one-quarter feet wide,","17":"with two pegs for securing them. Make all the frames identical:","18":"twenty frames for the south side","19":"with forty silver sockets to receive the two pegs from each of the twenty frames;","20":"the same construction on the north side of The Dwelling;","22":"for the rear of The Dwelling, which faces west, make six frames","23":"with two additional frames for the rear corners.","24":"Both of the two corner frames need to be double in thickness from top to bottom and fit into a single ring","25":"-eight frames altogether with sixteen sockets of silver, two under each frame.","26":"\"Now make crossbars of acacia wood, five for the frames on one side of The Dwelling,","27":"five for the other side, and five for the back side facing west.","28":"The center crossbar runs from end to end halfway up the frames.","29":"Cover the frames with a veneer of gold and make gold rings to hold the crossbars. And cover the crossbars with a veneer of gold.","30":"Then put The Dwelling together, following the design you were shown on the mountain.","31":"\"Make a curtain of blue, purple, and scarlet material and fine twisted linen. Have a design of angel-cherubim woven into it by a skilled craftsman.","32":"Fasten it with gold hooks to four posts of acacia wood covered with a veneer of gold, set on four silver bases.","33":"After hanging the curtain from the clasps, bring the Chest of The Testimony in behind the curtain. The curtain will separate the Holy Place from the Holy-of-Holies.","34":"Now place the Atonement-Cover lid on the Chest of The Testimony in the Holy-of-Holies.","35":"Place the Table and the Lampstand outside the curtain, the Lampstand on the south side of The Dwelling and the Table opposite it on the north side.","36":"\"Make a screen for the door of the tent. Weave it from blue, purple, and scarlet material and fine twisted linen.","37":"Frame the weaving with five poles of acacia wood covered with a veneer of gold and make gold hooks to hang the weaving. Cast five bronze bases for the poles."}
