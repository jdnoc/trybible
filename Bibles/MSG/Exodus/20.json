{"1":"GOD spoke all these words:","2":"I am GOD, your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of a life of slavery.","3":"No other gods, only me.","4":"No carved gods of any size, shape, or form of anything whatever, whether of things that fly or walk or swim.","5":"Don't bow down to them and don't serve them because I am GOD your God, and I'm a most jealous God, punishing the children for any sins their parents pass on to them to the third, and yes, even to the fourth generation of those who hate me.","6":"But I'm unswervingly loyal to the thousands who love me and keep my commandments.","7":"No using the name of GOD your God, in curses or silly banter; GOD won't put up with the irreverant use of his name.","8":"Observe the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.","9":"Work six days and do everything you need to do.","10":"But the seventh day is a Sabbath to GOD your God. Don't do any work--not you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your servant, nor your maid, nor your animals, not even the foreign guest visiting in your town.","11":"For in six days GOD made Heaven, Earth, and sea, and everything in them; he rested on the seventh day. Therefore GOD blessed the Sabbath day; he set it apart as a holy day.","12":"Honor your father and mother so that you'll live a long time in the land that GOD your God, is giving you.","13":"No murder.","14":"No adultery.","15":"No stealing.","16":"No lies about your neighbor.","17":"No lusting after your neighbor's house--or wife or servant or maid or ox or donkey. Don't set your heart on anything that is your neighbor's. [JC]","18":"All the people, experiencing the thunder and lightning, the trumpet blast and the smoking mountain, were afraid--they pulled back and stood at a distance.","19":"They said to Moses, \"You speak to us and we'll listen, but don't have God speak to us or we'll die.\"","20":"Moses spoke to the people: \"Don't be afraid. God has come to test you and instill a deep and reverent awe within you so that you won't sin.\"","21":"The people kept their distance while Moses approached the thick cloud where God was.","22":"GOD said to Moses, \"Give this Message to the People of Israel: \"You've experienced firsthand how I spoke with you from Heaven.","23":"Don't make gods of silver and gods of gold and then set them alongside me.","24":"Make me an earthen Altar. Sacrifice your Whole-Burnt-Offerings, your Peace-Offerings, your sheep, and your cattle on it. Every place where I cause my name to be honored in your worship, I'll be there myself and bless you.","25":"If you use stones to make my Altar, don't use dressed stones. If you use a chisel on the stones you'll profane the Altar.","26":"Don't use steps to climb to my Altar because that will expose your nakedness.' [JC]"}
