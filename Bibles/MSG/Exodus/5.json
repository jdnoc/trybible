{"1":"After that Moses and Aaron approached Pharaoh. They said, \"GOD, the God of Israel, says, \"Free my people so that they can hold a festival for me in the wilderness.'\"","2":"Pharaoh said, \"And who is GOD that I should listen to him and send Israel off? I know nothing of this so-called \"GOD' and I'm certainly not going to send Israel off.\"","3":"They said, \"The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Let us take a three-day journey into the wilderness so we can worship our GOD lest he strike us with either disease or death.\"","4":"But the king of Egypt said, \"Why on earth, Moses and Aaron, would you suggest the people be given a holiday? Back to work!\"","5":"Pharaoh went on, \"Look, I've got all these people bumming around, and now you want to reward them with time off?\"","6":"Pharaoh took immediate action. He sent down orders to the slave-drivers and their underlings:","7":"\"Don't provide straw for the people for making bricks as you have been doing. Make them get their own straw.","8":"And make them produce the same number of bricks--no reduction in their daily quotas! They're getting lazy. They're going around saying, \"Give us time off so we can worship our God.'","9":"Crack down on them. That'll cure them of their whining, their god-fantasies.\"","10":"The slave-drivers and their underlings went out to the people with their new instructions. \"Pharaoh's orders: No more straw provided.","11":"Get your own straw wherever you can find it. And not one brick less in your daily work quota!\"","12":"The people scattered all over Egypt scrabbling for straw.","13":"The slave-drivers were merciless, saying, \"Complete your daily quota of bricks--the same number as when you were given straw.\"","14":"The Israelite foremen whom the slave-drivers had appointed were beaten and badgered. \"Why didn't you finish your quota of bricks yesterday or the day before--and now again today!\"","15":"The Israelite foremen came to Pharaoh and cried out for relief: \"Why are you treating your servants like this?","16":"Nobody gives us any straw and they tell us, \"Make bricks!' Look at us--we're being beaten. And it's not our fault.\"","17":"But Pharaoh said, \"Lazy! That's what you are! Lazy! That's why you whine, \"Let us go so we can worship GOD.'","18":"Well then, go--go back to work. Nobody's going to give you straw, and at the end of the day you better bring in your full quota of bricks.\"","19":"The Israelite foremen saw that they were in a bad way, having to go back and tell their workers, \"Not one brick short in your daily quota.\"","20":"As they left Pharaoh, they found Moses and Aaron waiting to meet them.","21":"The foremen said to them, \"May GOD see what you've done and judge you--you've made us stink before Pharaoh and his servants! You've put a weapon in his hand that's going to kill us!\"","22":"Moses went back to GOD and said, \"My Master, why are you treating this people so badly? And why did you ever send me?","23":"From the moment I came to Pharaoh to speak in your name, things have only gotten worse for this people. And rescue? Does this look like rescue to you?\""}
