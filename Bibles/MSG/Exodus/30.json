And don't pour out Drink-Offerings on it.","10":"Once a year Aaron is to purify the Altar horns. Using the blood of the Absolution-Offering of atonement, he is to make this atonement every year down through the generations. It is most holy to GOD.\"","11":"GOD spoke to Moses:","12":"\"When you take a head count of the Israelites to keep track of them, all must pay an atonement-tax to GOD for their life at the time of being registered so that nothing bad will happen because of the registration.","13":"Everyone who gets counted is to give a half-shekel (using the standard Sanctuary shekel of a fifth of an ounce to the shekel)-a half-shekel offering to GOD.","14":"Everyone counted, age twenty and up, is to make the offering to GOD.","15":"The rich are not to pay more nor the poor less than the half-shekel offering to GOD, the atonement-tax for your lives.","16":"Take the atonement-tax money from the Israelites and put it to the maintenance of the Tent of Meeting.

This is the rule forever, for Aaron and his sons down through the generations.\"","22":"GOD spoke to Moses:","23":"\"Take the best spices: twelve and a half pounds of liquid myrrh; half that much, six and a quarter pounds, of fragrant cinnamon; six and a quarter pounds of fragrant cane;","24":"twelve and a half pounds of cassia--using the standard Sanctuary weight for all of them--and a gallon of olive oil.","25":"Make these into a holy anointing oil, a perfumer's skillful blend.","26":"\"Use it to anoint the Tent of Meeting, the Chest of The Testimony,","27":"the Table and all its utensils, the Lampstand and its utensils, the Altar of Incense,","28":"the Altar of Whole-Burnt-Offerings and all its utensils, and the Washbasin and its base.","29":"Consecrate them so they'll be soaked in holiness, so that anyone who so much as touches them will become holy.","30":"\"Then anoint Aaron and his sons.
