Cover it with a veneer of pure gold inside and out and make a molding of gold all around it.","12":"Cast four gold rings and attach them to its four feet, two rings on one side and two rings on the other.","13":"Make poles from acacia wood and cover them with a veneer of gold","14":"and insert them into the rings on the sides of the Chest for carrying the Chest.","15":"The poles are to stay in the rings; they must not be removed.","16":"\"Place The Testimony that I give you in the Chest.","17":"\"Now make a lid of pure gold for the Chest, an Atonement-Cover, three and three-quarters feet long and two and one-quarter feet wide.","18":"\"Sculpt two winged angels out of hammered gold for either end of the Atonement-Cover,","19":"one angel at one end, one angel at the other. Make them of one piece with the Atonement-Cover.","20":"Make the angels with their wings spread, hovering over the Atonement-Cover, facing one another but looking down on it.","21":"Set the Atonement-Cover as a lid over the Chest and place in the Chest The Testimony that I will give you.","22":"I will meet you there at set times and speak with you from above the Atonement-Cover and from between the angel-figures that are on it, speaking the commands that I have for the Israelites.","23":"\"Next make a Table from acacia wood. Make it three feet long, one and one-half feet wide and two and one-quarter feet high.","24":"Cover it with a veneer of pure gold. Make a molding all around it of gold.","25":"Make the border a handbreadth wide all around it and a rim of gold for the border.","26":"Make four rings of gold and attach the rings to the four legs","27":"parallel to the table top. They will serve as holders for the poles used to carry the Table.","28":"Make the poles of acacia wood and cover them with a veneer of gold. They will be used to carry the Table.","29":"\"Make plates, bowls, jars, and jugs for pouring out offerings. Make them of pure gold.","30":"\"Always keep fresh Bread of the Presence on the Table before me.","31":"\"Make a Lampstand of pure hammered gold. Make its stem and branches, cups, calyxes, and petals all of one piece.","32":"Give it six branches, three from one side and three from the other;","33":"put three cups shaped like almond blossoms, each with calyx and petals, on one branch, three on the next, and so on--the same for all six branches.","34":"On the main stem of the Lampstand, make four cups shaped like almonds, with calyx and petals,","35":"a calyx extending from under each pair of the six branches,","36":"the entire Lampstand fashioned from one piece of hammered pure gold.","37":"\"Make seven of these lamps for the Table. Arrange the lamps so they throw their light out in front.","38":"Make the candle snuffers and trays out of pure gold.","39":"\"Use a seventy-five-pound brick of pure gold to make the Lampstand and its accessories.","40":"Study the design you were given on the mountain and make everything accordingly."}
