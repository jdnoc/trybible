{"1":"\"Come on, let's go back to GOD. He hurt us, but he'll heal us. He hit us hard, but he'll put us right again.","2":"In a couple of days we'll feel better. By the third day he'll have made us brand-new, Alive and on our feet, fit to face him.","3":"We're ready to study GOD, eager for God-knowledge. As sure as dawn breaks, so sure is his daily arrival. He comes as rain comes, as spring rain refreshing the ground.\" [JC]","4":"\"What am I to do with you, Ephraim? What do I make of you, Judah? Your declarations of love last no longer than morning mist and predawn dew.","5":"That's why I use prophets to shake you to attention, why my words cut you to the quick: To wake you up to my judgment blazing like light.","6":"I'm after love that lasts, not more religion. I want you to know GOD, not go to more prayer meetings.","7":"You broke the covenant--just like Adam! You broke faith with me--ungrateful wretches!","8":"\"Gilead has become Crime City--blood on the sidewalks, blood on the streets.","9":"It used to be robbers who mugged pedestrians. Now it's gangs of priests Assaulting worshipers on their way to Shechem. Nothing is sacred to them.","10":"\"I saw a shocking thing in the country of Israel: Ephraim worshiping in a religious whorehouse, and Israel in the mud right there with him.","11":"\"You're as bad as the worst of them, Judah. You've been sowing wild oats. Now it's harvest time."}
