{"1":"\"Every time I gave Israel a fresh start, wiped the slate clean and got them going again, Ephraim soon filled the slate with new sins, the treachery of Samaria written out in bold print. Two-faced and double-tongued, they steal you blind, pick you clean.","2":"It never crosses their mind that I keep account of their every crime. They're mud-spattered head to toe with the residue of sin. I see who they are and what they've done.","3":"\"They entertain the king with their evil circus, delight the princes with their acrobatic lies.","4":"They're a bunch of overheated adulterers, like an oven that holds its heat From the kneading of the dough to the rising of the bread.","5":"On the royal holiday the princes get drunk on wine and the frenzy of the mocking mob.","6":"They're like wood stoves, red-hot with lust. Through the night their passion is banked; in the morning it blazes up, flames hungrily licking.","7":"Murderous and volcanic, they incinerate their rulers. Their kings fall one by one, and no one pays any attention to me.","8":"\"Ephraim mingles with the pagans, dissipating himself. Ephraim is half-baked.","9":"Strangers suck him dry but he doesn't even notice. His hair has turned gray--he doesn't notice.","10":"Bloated by arrogance, big as a house, Israel's a public disgrace. Israel lumbers along oblivious to GOD, despite all the signs, ignoring GOD.","11":"\"Ephraim is bird-brained, mindless, clueless, First chirping after Egypt, then fluttering after Assyria.","12":"I'll throw my net over them. I'll clip their wings. I'll teach them to mind me!","13":"Doom! They've run away from home. Now they're really in trouble! They've defied me. And I'm supposed to help them while they feed me a line of lies?","14":"Instead of crying out to me in heartfelt prayer, they whoop it up in bed with their whores, Gash themselves bloody in their sex-and-religion orgies, but turn their backs on me.","15":"I'm the one who gave them good minds and healthy bodies, and how am I repaid? With evil scheming!","16":"They turn, but not to me--turn here, then there, like a weather vane. Their rulers will be cut down, murdered--just deserts for their mocking blasphemies. And the final sentence? Ridicule in the court of world opinion."}
