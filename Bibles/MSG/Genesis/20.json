{"1":"Abraham traveled from there south to the Negev and settled down between Kadesh and Shur. While he was camping in Gerar,","2":"Abraham said of his wife Sarah, \"She's my sister.\" So Abimelech, king of Gerar, sent for Sarah and took her.","3":"But God came to Abimelech in a dream that night and told him, \"You're as good as dead--that woman you took, she's a married woman.\"","4":"Now Abimelech had not yet slept with her, hadn't so much as touched her. He said, \"Master, would you kill an innocent man?","5":"Didn't he tell me, \"She's my sister'? And didn't she herself say, \"He's my brother'? I had no idea I was doing anything wrong when I did this.\"","6":"God said to him in the dream, \"Yes, I know your intentions were pure, that's why I kept you from sinning against me; I was the one who kept you from going to bed with her.","7":"So now give the man's wife back to him. He's a prophet and will pray for you--pray for your life. If you don't give her back, know that it's certain death both for you and everyone in your family.\"","8":"Abimelech was up first thing in the morning. He called all his house servants together and told them the whole story. They were shocked.","9":"Then Abimelech called in Abraham and said, \"What have you done to us? What have I ever done to you that you would bring on me and my kingdom this huge offense? What you've done to me ought never to have been done.\"","10":"Abimelech went on to Abraham, \"Whatever were you thinking of when you did this thing?\"","11":"Abraham said, \"I just assumed that there was no fear of God in this place and that they'd kill me to get my wife.","12":"Besides, the truth is that she is my half sister; she's my father's daughter but not my mother's.","13":"When God sent me out as a wanderer from my father's home, I told her, \"Do me a favor; wherever we go, tell people that I'm your brother.'\"","14":"Then Abimelech gave Sarah back to Abraham, and along with her sent sheep and cattle and servants, both male and female.","15":"He said, \"My land is open to you; live wherever you wish.\"","16":"And to Sarah he said, \"I've given your brother a thousand pieces of silver--that clears you of even a shadow of suspicion before the eyes of the world. You're vindicated.\"","17":"Then Abraham prayed to God and God healed Abimelech, his wife and his maidservants, and they started having babies again.","18":"For GOD had shut down every womb in Abimelech's household on account of Sarah, Abraham's wife.
