{"1":"Next GOD said to Noah, \"Now board the ship, you and all your family--out of everyone in this generation, you're the righteous one.","2":"\"Take on board with you seven pairs of every clean animal, a male and a female; one pair of every unclean animal, a male and a female;","3":"and seven pairs of every kind of bird, a male and a female, to insure their survival on Earth.","4":"In just seven days I will dump rain on Earth for forty days and forty nights. I'll make a clean sweep of everything that I've made.\"","5":"Noah did everything GOD commanded him.","6":"Noah was 600 years old when the floodwaters covered the Earth.","7":"Noah and his wife and sons and their wives boarded the ship to escape the flood.","8":"Clean and unclean animals, birds, and all the crawling creatures","9":"came in pairs to Noah and to the ship, male and female, just as God had commanded Noah.","10":"In seven days the floodwaters came.","11":"It was the six-hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month that it happened: all the underground springs erupted and all the windows of Heaven were thrown open.","12":"Rain poured for forty days and forty nights.","13":"That's the day Noah and his sons Shem, Ham, and Japheth, accompanied by his wife and his sons' wives, boarded the ship.","14":"And with them every kind of wild and domestic animal, right down to all the kinds of creatures that crawl and all kinds of birds and anything that flies.","15":"They came to Noah and to the ship in pairs--everything and anything that had the breath of life in it,","16":"male and female of every creature came just as God had commanded Noah. Then GOD shut the door behind him.","17":"The flood continued forty days and the waters rose and lifted the ship high over the Earth.","18":"The waters kept rising, the flood deepened on the Earth, the ship floated on the surface.","19":"The flood got worse until all the highest mountains were covered","20":"-the high water mark reached twenty feet above the crest of the mountains.","21":"Everything died. Anything that moved-dead. Birds, farm animals, wild animals, the entire teeming exuberance of life--dead. And all people--dead.","22":"Every living, breathing creature that lived on dry land died;","23":"he wiped out the whole works-people and animals, crawling creatures and flying birds, every last one of them, gone. Only Noah and his company on the ship lived.","24":"The floodwaters took over for 150 days."}
