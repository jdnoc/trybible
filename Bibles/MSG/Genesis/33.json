{"1":"Jacob looked up and saw Esau coming with his four hundred men. He divided the children between Leah and Rachel and the two maidservants.","2":"He put the maidservants out in front, Leah and her children next, and Rachel and Joseph last.","3":"He led the way and, as he approached his brother, bowed seven times, honoring his brother.","4":"But Esau ran up and embraced him, held him tight and kissed him. And they both wept.","5":"Then Esau looked around and saw the women and children: \"And who are these with you?\" Jacob said, \"The children that God saw fit to bless me with.\"","6":"Then the maidservants came up with their children and bowed;","7":"then Leah and her children, also bowing; and finally, Joseph and Rachel came up and bowed to Esau.","8":"Esau then asked, \"And what was the meaning of all those herds that I met?I was hoping that they would pave the way for my master to welcome me.\"","9":"Esau said, \"Oh, brother. I have plenty of everything--keep what is yours for yourself.\"","10":"Jacob said, \"Please. If you can find it in your heart to welcome me, accept these gifts. When I saw your face, it was as the face of God smiling on me.","11":"Accept the gifts I have brought for you. God has been good to me and I have more than enough.\" Jacob urged the gifts on him and Esau accepted.","12":"Then Esau said, \"Let's start out on our way; I'll take the lead.\"","13":"But Jacob said, \"My master can see that the children are frail. And the flocks and herds are nursing, making for slow going. If I push them too hard, even for a day, I'd lose them all.","14":"So, master, you go on ahead of your servant, while I take it easy at the pace of my flocks and children. I'll catch up with you in Seir.\"","15":"Esau said, \"Let me at least lend you some of my men.There's no need,\" said Jacob. \"Your generous welcome is all I need or want.\"","16":"So Esau set out that day and made his way back to Seir.","17":"And Jacob left for Succoth. He built a shelter for himself and sheds for his livestock. That's how the place came to be called Succoth (Sheds).","18":"And that's how it happened that Jacob arrived all in one piece in Shechem in the land of Canaan--all the way from Paddan Aram. He camped near the city.","19":"He bought the land where he pitched his tent from the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem. He paid a hundred silver coins for it.","20":"Then he built an altar there and named it El-Elohe-Israel (Mighty Is the God of Israel). [JC]"}
