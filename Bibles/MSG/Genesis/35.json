I'm going to build an altar there to the God who answered me when I was in trouble and has stuck with me everywhere I've gone since.\"","4":"They turned over to Jacob all the alien gods they'd been holding on to, along with their lucky-charm earrings. Jacob buried them under the oak tree in Shechem.","5":"Then they set out. A paralyzing fear descended on all the surrounding villages so that they were unable to pursue the sons of Jacob.","6":"Jacob and his company arrived at Luz, that is, Bethel, in the land of Canaan.","7":"He built an altar there and named it El-Bethel (God-of-Bethel) because that's where God revealed himself to him when he was running from his brother.","8":"And that's when Rebekah's nurse, Deborah, died. She was buried just below Bethel under the oak tree. It was named Allon-Bacuth (Weeping-Oak).","9":"God revealed himself once again to Jacob, after he had come back from Paddan Aram and blessed him:","10":"\"Your name is Jacob (Heel); but that's your name no longer. From now on your name is Israel (God-Wrestler).\"","11":"God continued, I am The Strong God. Have children! Flourish! A nation--a whole company of nations!- will come from you. Kings will come from your loins;","12":"the land I gave Abraham and Isaac I now give to you, and pass it on to your descendants.","13":"And then God was gone, ascended from the place where he had spoken with him.","14":"Jacob set up a stone pillar on the spot where God had spoken with him. He poured a drink offering on it and anointed it with oil.","15":"Jacob dedicated the place where God had spoken with him, Bethel (God's-House). [JC]","16":"They left Bethel. They were still quite a ways from Ephrath when Rachel went into labor--hard, hard labor.","17":"When her labor pains were at their worst, the midwife said to her, \"Don't be afraid--you have another boy.\"","18":"With her last breath, for she was now dying, she named him Ben-oni (Son-of-My-Pain), but his father named him Ben-jamin (Son-of-Good-Fortune).","19":"Rachel died and was buried on the road to Ephrath, that is, Bethlehem.","20":"Jacob set up a pillar to mark her grave.

He was buried with his family by his sons Esau and Jacob. [JC]"}
