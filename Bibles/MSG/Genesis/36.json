{"1":"This is the family tree of Esau, who is also called Edom.","2":"Esau married women of Canaan: Adah, daughter of Elon the Hittite; Oholibamah, daughter of Anah and the granddaughter of Zibeon the Hivite;","3":"and Basemath, daughter of Ishmael and sister of Nebaioth.","4":"Adah gave Esau Eliphaz; Basemath had Reuel;","5":"Oholibamah had Jeush, Jalam, and Korah. These are the sons of Esau who were born to him in the land of Canaan.","6":"Esau gathered up his wives, sons and daughters, and everybody in his household, along with all his livestock--all the animals and possessions he had gotten in Canaan--and moved a considerable distance away from his brother Jacob.","7":"The brothers had too many possessions to live together in the same place; the land couldn't support their combined herds of livestock.","8":"So Esau ended up settling in the hill country of Seir (Esau and Edom are the same).","9":"So this is the family tree of Esau, ancestor of the people of Edom, in the hill country of Seir.","10":"The names of Esau's sons: Eliphaz, son of Esau's wife Adah; Reuel, son of Esau's wife Basemath.","11":"The sons of Eliphaz: Teman, Omar, Zepho, Gatam, and Kenaz.","12":"(Eliphaz also had a concubine Timna, who had Amalek.) These are the grandsons of Esau's wife Adah.","13":"And these are the sons of Reuel: Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah--grandsons of Esau's wife Basemath.","14":"These are the sons of Esau's wife Oholibamah, daughter of Anah the son of Zibeon. She gave Esau his sons Jeush, Jalam, and Korah.","15":"These are the chieftains in Esau's family tree. From the sons of Eliphaz, Esau's firstborn, came the chieftains Teman, Omar, Zepho, Kenaz,","16":"Korah, Gatam, and Amalek--the chieftains of Eliphaz in the land of Edom; all of them sons of Adah.","17":"From the sons of Esau's son Reuel, came the chieftains Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. These are the chieftains of Reuel in the land of Edom; all these were sons of Esau's wife Basemath.","18":"These are the sons of Esau's wife Oholibamah: the chieftains Jeush, Jalam, and Korah--chieftains born of Esau's wife Oholibamah, daughter of Anah.","19":"These are the sons of Esau, that is, Edom, and these are their chieftains.","20":"This is the family tree of Seir the Horite, who were native to that land: Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah,","21":"Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan. These are the chieftains of the Horites, the sons of Seir in the land of Edom.","22":"The sons of Lotan were Hori and Homam; Lotan's sister was Timna.","23":"The sons of Shobal were Alvan, Manahath, Ebal, Shepho, and Onam.","24":"The sons of Zibeon were Aiah and Anah--this is the same Anah who found the hot springs in the wilderness while herding his father Zibeon's donkeys.","25":"The children of Anah were Dishon and his daughter Oholibamah.","26":"The sons of Dishon were Hemdan, Eshban, Ithran, and Keran.","27":"The sons of Ezer: Bilhan, Zaavan, and Akan.","28":"The sons of Dishan: Uz and Aran.","29":"And these were the Horite chieftains: Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah,","30":"Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan--the Horite chieftains clan by clan in the land of Seir.","31":"And these are the kings who ruled in Edom before there was a king in Israel:","32":"Bela son of Beor was the king of Edom; the name of his city was Dinhabah.","33":"When Bela died, Jobab son of Zerah from Bozrah became the next king.","34":"When Jobab died, he was followed by Hushan from the land of the Temanites.","35":"When Hushan died, he was followed by Hadad son of Bedad; he was the king who defeated the Midianites in Moab; the name of his city was Avith.","36":"When Hadad died, Samlah of Masrekah became the next king.","37":"When Samlah died, Shaul from Rehoboth-on-the-River became king.","38":"When Shaul died, he was followed by Baal-Hanan son of Acbor.","39":"When Baal-Hanan son of Acbor died, Hadad became king; the name of his city was Pau; his wife's name was Mehetabel daughter of Matred, daughter of Me-Zahab.","40":"And these are the chieftains from the line of Esau, clan by clan, region by region: Timna, Alvah, Jetheth,","41":"Oholibamah, Elah, Pinon,","42":"Kenaz, Teman, Mibzar,","43":"Magdiel, and Iram--the chieftains of Edom as they occupied their various regions. This accounts for the family tree of Esau, ancestor of all Edomites."}
