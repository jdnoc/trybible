{"1":"Adam slept with Eve his wife. She conceived and had Cain. She said, \"I've gotten a man, with GOD's help!\"","2":"Then she had another baby, Abel. Abel was a herdsman and Cain a farmer.","3":"Time passed. Cain brought an offering to GOD from the produce of his farm.","4":"Abel also brought an offering, but from the firstborn animals of his herd, choice cuts of meat. GOD liked Abel and his offering,","5":"but Cain and his offering didn't get his approval. Cain lost his temper and went into a sulk.","6":"GOD spoke to Cain: \"Why this tantrum? Why the sulking?","7":"If you do well, won't you be accepted? And if you don't do well, sin is lying in wait for you, ready to pounce; it's out to get you, you've got to master it.\"","8":"Cain had words with his brother. They were out in the field; Cain came at Abel his brother and killed him.","9":"GOD said to Cain, \"Where is Abel your brother?\" He said, \"How should I know? Am I his babysitter?\"","10":"GOD said, \"What have you done! The voice of your brother's blood is calling to me from the ground.","11":"From now on you'll get nothing but curses from this ground; you'll be driven from this ground that has opened its arms to receive the blood of your murdered brother.","12":"You'll farm this ground, but it will no longer give you its best. You'll be a homeless wanderer on Earth.\"","13":"Cain said to GOD, \"My punishment is too much. I can't take it!","14":"You've thrown me off the land and I can never again face you. I'm a homeless wanderer on Earth and whoever finds me will kill me.\"","15":"GOD told him, \"No. Anyone who kills Cain will pay for it seven times over.\" GOD put a mark on Cain to protect him so that no one who met him would kill him.","16":"Cain left the presence of GOD and lived in No-Man's-Land, east of Eden.","17":"Cain slept with his wife. She conceived and had Enoch. He then built a city and named it after his son, Enoch.","18":"Enoch had Irad, Irad had Mehujael, Mehujael had Methushael, Methushael had Lamech.","19":"Lamech married two wives, Adah and Zillah.","20":"Adah gave birth to Jabal, the ancestor of all who live in tents and herd cattle.","21":"His brother's name was Jubal, the ancestor of all who play the lyre and flute.","22":"Zillah gave birth to Tubal-Cain, who worked at the forge making bronze and iron tools. Tubal-Cain's sister was Naamah.","23":"Lamech said to his wives, Adah and Zillah, listen to me; you wives of Lamech, hear me out: I killed a man for wounding me, a young man who attacked me.","24":"If Cain is avenged seven times, for Lamech it's seventy-seven!","25":"Adam slept with his wife again. She had a son whom she named Seth. She said, \"God has given me another child in place of Abel whom Cain killed.\"","26":"And then Seth had a son whom he named Enosh. That's when men and women began praying and worshiping in the name of GOD."}
