{"1":"I saw a scroll in the right hand of the One Seated on the Throne. It was written on both sides, fastened with seven seals.","2":"I also saw a powerful Angel, calling out in a voice like thunder, \"Is there anyone who can open the scroll, who can break its seals?\"","3":"There was no one--no one in Heaven, no one on earth, no one from the underworld--able to break open the scroll and read it.","4":"I wept and wept and wept that no one was found able to open the scroll, able to read it.","5":"One of the Elders said, \"Don't weep. Look--the Lion from Tribe Judah, the Root of David's Tree, has conquered. He can open the scroll, can rip through the seven seals.\"","6":"So I looked, and there, surrounded by Throne, Animals, and Elders, was a Lamb, slaughtered but standing tall. Seven horns he had, and seven eyes, the Seven Spirits of God sent into all the earth.","7":"He came to the One Seated on the Throne and took the scroll from his right hand.","8":"The moment he took the scroll, the Four Animals and Twenty-four Elders fell down and worshiped the Lamb. Each had a harp and each had a bowl, a gold bowl filled with incense, the prayers of God's holy people.","9":"And they sang a new song: Worthy! Take the scroll, open its seals. Slain! Paying in blood, you bought men and women, Bought them back from all over the earth, Bought them back for God.","10":"Then you made them a Kingdom, Priests for our God, Priest-kings to rule over the earth.","11":"I looked again. I heard a company of Angels around the Throne, the Animals, and the Elders--ten thousand times ten thousand their number, thousand after thousand after thousand","12":"in full song: The slain Lamb is worthy! Take the power, the wealth, the wisdom, the strength! Take the honor, the glory, the blessing!","13":"Then I heard every creature in Heaven and earth, in underworld and sea, join in, all voices in all places, singing: To the One on the Throne! To the Lamb! The blessing, the honor, the glory, the strength, For age after age after age.","14":"The Four Animals called out, \"Oh, Yes! \"The Elders fell to their knees and worshiped."}
