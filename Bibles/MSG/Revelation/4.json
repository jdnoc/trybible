{"1":"Then I looked, and, oh!-a door open into Heaven. The trumpet-voice, the first voice in my vision, called out, \"Ascend and enter. I'll show you what happens next.\"","2":"I was caught up at once in deep worship and, oh!-a Throne set in Heaven with One Seated on the Throne,","3":"suffused in gem hues of amber and flame with a nimbus of emerald.","4":"Twenty-four thrones circled the Throne, with Twenty-four Elders seated, white-robed, gold-crowned.","5":"Lightning flash and thunder crash pulsed from the Throne. Seven fire-blazing torches fronted the Throne (these are the Sevenfold Spirit of God).","6":"Before the Throne it was like a clear crystal sea. Prowling around the Throne were Four Animals, all eyes. Eyes to look ahead, eyes to look behind.","7":"The first Animal like a lion, the second like an ox, the third with a human face, the fourth like an eagle in flight.","8":"The Four Animals were winged, each with six wings. They were all eyes, seeing around and within. And they chanted night and day, never taking a break: Holy, holy, holy Is God our Master, Sovereign-Strong, THE WAS, THE IS, THE COMING.","9":"Every time the Animals gave glory and honor and thanks to the One Seated on the Throne--the age-after-age Living One--","10":"the Twenty-four Elders would fall prostrate before the One Seated on the Throne. They worshiped the age-after-age Living One. They threw their crowns at the foot of the Throne, chanting,","11":"Worthy, O Master! Yes, our God! Take the glory! the honor! the power! You created it all; It was created because you wanted it."}
