{"1":"Forsooth for many men endeavoured to ordain the telling of things, which be filled in us. So many others have tried their hand at putting together a story of the wonderful harvest of Scripture and history that took place among us,","2":"using reports handed down by the original eyewitnesses who served this Word with their very lives.","3":"Since I have investigated all the reports in close detail, starting from the story's beginning, I decided to write it all out for you, most honorable Theophilus,","4":"so you can know beyond the shadow of a doubt the reliability of what you were taught.","5":"During the rule of Herod, King of Judea, there was a priest assigned service in the regiment of Abijah. His name was Zachariah. His wife was descended from the daughters of Aaron. Her name was Elizabeth.","6":"Together they lived honorably before God, careful in keeping to the ways of the commandments and enjoying a clear conscience before God.","7":"But they were childless because Elizabeth could never conceive, and now they were quite old.","8":"It so happened that as Zachariah was carrying out his priestly duties before God, working the shift assigned to his regiment,","9":"it came his one turn in life to enter the sanctuary of God and burn incense.","10":"The congregation was gathered and praying outside the Temple at the hour of the incense offering.","11":"Unannounced, an angel of God appeared just to the right of the altar of incense.","12":"Zachariah was paralyzed in fear.","13":"But the angel reassured him, \"Don't fear, Zachariah. Your prayer has been heard. Elizabeth, your wife, will bear a son by you. You are to name him John.","14":"You're going to leap like a gazelle for joy, and not only you--many will delight in his birth.","15":"He'll achieve great stature with God. \"He'll drink neither wine nor beer. He'll be filled with the Holy Spirit from the moment he leaves his mother's womb.","16":"He will turn many sons and daughters of Israel back to their God.","17":"He will herald God's arrival in the style and strength of Elijah, soften the hearts of parents to children, and kindle devout understanding among hardened skeptics--he'll get the people ready for God.\"","18":"Zachariah said to the angel, \"Do you expect me to believe this? I'm an old man and my wife is an old woman.\"","19":"But the angel said, \"I am Gabriel, the sentinel of God, sent especially to bring you this glad news.","20":"But because you won't believe me, you'll be unable to say a word until the day of your son's birth. Every word I've spoken to you will come true on time--God's time.\"","21":"Meanwhile, the congregation waiting for Zachariah was getting restless, wondering what was keeping him so long in the sanctuary.","22":"When he came out and couldn't speak, they knew he had seen a vision. He continued speechless and had to use sign language with the people.","23":"When the course of his priestly assignment was completed, he went back home.[","24":"It wasn't long before his wife, Elizabeth, conceived. She went off by herself for five months, relishing her pregnancy.","25":"\"So, this is how God acts to remedy my unfortunate condition!\" she said.","26":"In the sixth month of Elizabeth's pregnancy, God sent the angel Gabriel to the Galilean village of Nazareth","27":"to a virgin engaged to be married to a man descended from David. His name was Joseph, and the virgin's name, Mary.","28":"Upon entering, Gabriel greeted her: Good morning! You're beautiful with God's beauty, Beautiful inside and out! God be with you.","29":"She was thoroughly shaken, wondering what was behind a greeting like that.","30":"But the angel assured her, \"Mary, you have nothing to fear. God has a surprise for you:","31":"You will become pregnant and give birth to a son and call his name Jesus.","32":"He will be great, be called \"Son of the Highest.' The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David;","33":"He will rule Jacob's house forever--no end, ever, to his kingdom.\"","34":"Mary said to the angel, \"But how? I've never slept with a man.\"","35":"The angel answered, The Holy Spirit will come upon you, the power of the Highest hover over you; Therefore, the child you bring to birth will be called Holy, Son of God.","36":"\"And did you know that your cousin Elizabeth conceived a son, old as she is? Everyone called her barren, and here she is six months' pregnant!","37":"Nothing, you see, is impossible with God.\"","38":"And Mary said, Yes, I see it all now: I'm the Lord's maid, ready to serve. Let it be with me just as you say. Then the angel left her.","39":"Mary didn't waste a minute. She got up and traveled to a town in Judah in the hill country,","40":"straight to Zachariah's house, and greeted Elizabeth.","41":"When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the baby in her womb leaped. She was filled with the Holy Spirit,","42":"and sang out exuberantly, You're so blessed among women, and the babe in your womb, also blessed!","43":"And why am I so blessed that the mother of my Lord visits me?","44":"The moment the sound of your greeting entered my ears, The babe in my womb skipped like a lamb for sheer joy.","45":"Blessed woman, who believed what God said, believed every word would come true!","46":"And Mary said, I'm bursting with God-news;","47":"I'm dancing the song of my Savior God.","48":"God took one good look at me, and look what happened--I'm the most fortunate woman on earth! What God has done for me will never be forgotten,","49":"the God whose very name is holy, set apart from all others.","50":"His mercy flows in wave after wave on those who are in awe before him.","51":"He bared his arm and showed his strength, scattered the bluffing braggarts.","52":"He knocked tyrants off their high horses, pulled victims out of the mud.","53":"The starving poor sat down to a banquet; the callous rich were left out in the cold.","54":"He embraced his chosen child, Israel; he remembered and piled on the mercies, piled them high.","55":"It's exactly what he promised, beginning with Abraham and right up to now.","56":"Mary stayed with Elizabeth for three months and then went back to her own home.","57":"When Elizabeth was full-term in her pregnancy, she bore a son.","58":"Her neighbors and relatives, seeing that God had overwhelmed her with mercy, celebrated with her.","59":"On the eighth day, they came to circumcise the child and were calling him Zachariah after his father.","60":"But his mother intervened: \"No. He is to be called John.\"","61":"\"But,\" they said, \"no one in your family is named that.\"","62":"They used sign language to ask Zachariah what he wanted him named.","63":"Asking for a tablet, Zachariah wrote, \"His name is to be John.\" That took everyone by surprise.","64":"Surprise followed surprise--Zachariah's mouth was now open, his tongue loose, and he was talking, praising God!","65":"A deep, reverential fear settled over the neighborhood, and in all that Judean hill country people talked about nothing else.","66":"Everyone who heard about it took it to heart, wondering, \"What will become of this child? Clearly, God has his hand in this.\"","67":"Then Zachariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied,","68":"Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel; he came and set his people free.","69":"He set the power of salvation in the center of our lives, and in the very house of David his servant,","70":"Just as he promised long ago through the preaching of his holy prophets:","71":"Deliverance from our enemies and every hateful hand;","72":"Mercy to our fathers, as he remembers to do what he said he'd do,","73":"What he swore to our father Abraham--","74":"a clean rescue from the enemy camp, So we can worship him without a care in the world,","75":"made holy before him as long as we live.","76":"And you, my child, \"Prophet of the Highest,\" will go ahead of the Master to prepare his ways,","77":"Present the offer of salvation to his people, the forgiveness of their sins.","78":"Through the heartfelt mercies of our God, God's Sunrise will break in upon us,","79":"Shining on those in the darkness, those sitting in the shadow of death, Then showing us the way, one foot at a time, down the path of peace.","80":"The child grew up, healthy and spirited. He lived out in the desert until the day he made his prophetic debut in Israel."}
