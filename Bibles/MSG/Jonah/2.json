{"1":"Then Jonah prayed to his God from the belly of the fish.","2":"He prayed: \"In trouble, deep trouble, I prayed to GOD. He answered me. From the belly of the grave I cried, \"Help!' You heard my cry.","3":"You threw me into ocean's depths, into a watery grave, With ocean waves, ocean breakers crashing over me.","4":"I said, \"I've been thrown away, thrown out, out of your sight. I'll never again lay eyes on your Holy Temple.'","5":"Ocean gripped me by the throat. The ancient Abyss grabbed me and held tight. My head was all tangled in seaweed","6":"at the bottom of the sea where the mountains take root. I was as far down as a body can go, and the gates were slamming shut behind me forever--Yet you pulled me up from that grave alive, O GOD, my God!","7":"When my life was slipping away, I remembered GOD, And my prayer got through to you, made it all the way to your Holy Temple.","8":"Those who worship hollow gods, god-frauds, walk away from their only true love.","9":"But I'm worshiping you, GOD, calling out in thanksgiving! And I'll do what I promised I'd do! Salvation belongs to GOD!\"","10":"Then GOD spoke to the fish, and it vomited up Jonah on the seashore."}
